Dear Fellow Members, distinguished guests,

My name is Lao Xie. I the current club Secretary, and immediate past president.
Now I am running for the election of next term's vice president education.

I have been in the club for almost 2 years, and I have done 2 Pathways, So I
believe I can handle the VPE role to the best of my ability.

As a VPE, I will

1. help the club members grow

2. orgnize high quality club meetings

To do this, I will

1. present each new member a package

# a Pathway for Toastmasters

# a qualified mentor

# a personalized growth plan


1. plan 6-month meeting schedule

# meeting theme

# Table Topics

# Prepared speeches

To fulfill the seemingly daunting tasks, I will definitely need help and
advice from each and every one of you: officers, members and guests. Please
don't hesitate to offer your ideas and contribution.

That's all my vision for the VPE.

Last but not least, is there any other member who wants to compete this position
with me?

Thank you.
