Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

A question to the members:

Do you know Pathways? (ok, most of you do.)

How many of you have done Pathways level-2? (good)

In Pathways level-2, we will determine how to improve our relationships
by mastering and adapting our communication styles and tailor our message
to match situational expectations.

This is an important project, and I feel it is hard: even if I know my
communication style is supportive, I am still not sure how to explore it
properly.

Dear audience, how you ever felt that when you regard some information as
important, you will expect that anyone exposed to that information will
fully absorb it?

When you told your friends Toastmasters are good, Yu-Life club is nice.
And invited them to come, but they didn't show up. This shows the reality:
while learning how to communicate well is hard, actually getting anyone
to listen is much harder.

Since mobile phones and social media all this has got many times harder
because attention spans are shorter. I find that there is higher
expectation that communication should start from being nice.

To be nice is to respect. I didn't realize this until I have a kid. Talking
to little kids can be frustrating sometimes - they just wouldn't listen. When
we stood straightly and talk to our son, he would not follow; if we lowered
our body and kept the same height as our kid, no matter what we want to
communicate, he started to listen and response. There is no need to raise our
voice and yell around. Being nice and respecting makes my life easier.

Even if we are on the weak side, being nice can also win us respect. Living
in a metropolis like Shanghai, we all cross the streets many times a day.
What would you do before you cross the street? (very good) When I am crossing
the stree and a car stopped and waited, I will give the driver a thumb-up
to show my respect to her nice behavior. I think both of us will feel happy
for the day. Don't you agree? Being nice makes my life happier.

To be nice is to be positive. We all want a relaxed, no-tension environment.
But sometime there is a conflict and there can be opinions I disagree. To
be nice is particularly necessary in these situations. For example, in our
meetings, an evaluator may use some strong words on my speech, I may feel
insulted. But I should still give my apprieciation. Anyway, the evaluator is
another human being, just like myself. She just intended to help me
regardless which word she uses in her evaluation. We all need forgive and
improve. If we can share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing
conversation, we are fine. Being nice and positive helps build a friendly
community.

All in all, whether your communication style is supportive as mine, or
direcct, or initiating, or analytical, you can always start you
communication from

Being nice!

Thank you.
