Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Many guests have been to our Toastmasters meeting several time, you may
heard the word 'Pathways' a few time.

Have you ever wondered what Pathways is?

Pathways is the essential Toastmasters education program. It is a supplement
of your club activity. From July of 2020, all Toastmasters members must
follow Pathways to get their credits in Pathways program.

Sounds mysterious, right?

Today we are trying to solve your worry and confusion about Pathways in our
Panel discussion. I am your panel moderator. My name is Lao Xie. My current
Pathways level is PM4.

I am very glad that we have 3 outstanding Toastmasters to share their expertise
in Pathways with us - three Js. Let me invite them to give a brief self-
introduction one by one.

First J, welcome Julie, present Vice President of Education in Yu-Life club,
EC2 in Pathways. Please introduce your self.
...Thank you, Julie.

Second J, welcome Jim, present President of CAAS club, in Pathways. Please
say some thing about yourself.
... Thank you, Jim.

The last J, welcome Justus, present secretary of Yu-Life club, EC5 and
in Pathways. Please tell us more about yourself.
... Thank you, Justus.

1. Julie, as the Vice President of Education (VPE), I understand that one
of your targets is to work on each member's Pathways plan. Could you please
tell us what Pathways is indeed?

Jim, from your point of president, what do you want to say besides what Julie
said？（example, how many Pathways in total)

Justus, you are the first one in our club to finish a whole Pathways. Do you
anything to add?


2. Justus, you already started your second Pathways. Please tell us how you
select your Pathways and how you started the first project.

Jim, how about you?
Julie, how about you?

(audience): Do you have any question till now? Please feel free to ask.


3. Justus, as we said you have done a full Pathways. How many speeches have did
for this Pathways? Which one is the most difficult and why?

Julie, how about you?
Jim, and you?

4. Julie, there is an apply and approval process of each project. As an VPE,
you are entitled to approval club members Pathways application. Could you
explain the process and how do you like it？

Justus, what is your feeling about the process？Are you satisfied with VPE's
feedback?

Jim, what is the situation in your club?

(audience questions)

5. Justus, you know in Toastmaster we have mentor and mentee relationship.
What your thought between this and the Pathways?
Jim, how about you?
Julie, and you?

6. Pathways progress is related to some speech contest eligibility. For
example, your have to be at least Pathways level-2 to take part in the
International speech contest. This is for individual members. On the
other hand, Pathways progress is also important for the Distinguished
Club Program.
Jim, could you explain this from your point of view?
Justus, how is your idea on this topic?
Julie, how about you?

(Audience) Time flies. We take the last question.
...

Now it's time the have a summary. Let's start from Julie.
Julie, could you please say some to the audience about today's
topic: Pathways?
Justus, ...
Jim, ...

Dear Audience, from our three Js's talk, I have learned a lot
about Pathways. The most important thing for me is to work on
my next project and do a high quality job.

Let's give our Panelist our warmest applaud and thanks.
Let's give ourselves a applaud, too. You have asked very good
questions.

Our Panel ends here.
Thank you and see you next time.
