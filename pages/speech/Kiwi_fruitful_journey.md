Dear fellow members and distinguished guests:

This is a strange fruit, isn't it?

It has strange name - kiwi. Its Chinese name is even stranger, right?

When I first had this fruit, I didn't know how to eat it. It looks like a simple
fruit: small, nestled within a fuzzy skin.

I touched it. It felt hairy. I bite the skin, and it tasted sour. But it started
to burst with bright green flesh. I sucked juicy liquid from its fleesh. Wow, I
felt a unique taste mixed with sweet and sour.

How you ever got that taste?

Later I learned that kiwi's journey begins in the distant landscapes of China. In
the early 20th century, the kiwi set sail on its first voyage to New Zealand.

When kiwi comes back to China with its strange name, I am almost afraid of this
little strange fruit. However, packed with Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and
antioxidants, the kiwi has proven itself to be a powerhouse of nutrition. It's
not just a fruit; it's a testament to the bountiful gifts that nature has to offer.

Apart from its nutrition, the act of eating a kiwi for me is an experience that
invites us to explore the unknown. At first glance, a kiwi is unassuming, its
fuzzy brown exterior concealing the vibrant life within. I, as the first-time
consumer might be wary, unsure of how to approach it. The exploration begins here.

When you bravely start the first bite, it is a rush of flavors â€“ sweet, sour, and
incredibly refreshing. It's an exploration of taste, a journey into the unknown that
rewards you with a delightful sensory experience.

Eating a kiwi is much like exploring the unknown - it involves curiosity, the willingness
to try something new, and the joy of discovery. It shows us that the unknown is not
something to fear but to embrace, for it holds the promise of new experiences, flavors,
and understandings.

The narrative of the kiwi serves as an allegory for our own lives. It encourages us to
venture into the unknown, to welcome change, to adapt, and to grow. Just as the kiwi
transformed from an obscure Chinese berry into a globally celebrated fruit, we too can
emerge from the realms of the unknown, stronger, more resilient, and more successful.

So, let's take a leaf from the kiwi's book. Let's embrace the unknown, venture out of
our comfort zones, and savor the sweet taste of discovery. After all, exploration is the
engine of progress, and every step into the unknown is a step towards growth.

Thank you.
