Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

My name is Laoxie, and I am today's SAA.

Let's do a warm-up game. I know you like warm-up games, and we have an
SAA project that we already collected more than 10 games. Many of our
club members contributed those games.

Why do we do warm-up games? Raise your hands if have an answer.

Good answers.

Warm-up games make our body warm and relax our body. Let's try my first
game.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, please stand up. In our meeting, we often do
one thing using our hands. What is that thing?

Yes, claps.

How many time do you think you can clap in 10 seconds?

10, 20, 30, good.
40, better.
50, best.

Let me pull our a timer. We can say - start. You start clapping as fast as
you can and counting. But it should be a real clap, not just touching hands.
When you hear stop, you stop.

Are you ready? Good.

Start
(timer for 5 seconds)
Stop

How many claps have you done?
10,
20,
30,
Do we have 40? Yes.
Do we have 50? Yes.

Great.

I think most of you have done what you have estimated. But you know, I have just
set the time for 5 seconds.

Waho, some of you may start to think how powerful our body could be, and how powerless
our mind could be. So I think the warm-up game is not only to warm up your body and it
is also going to wake up and warm up your powerful mind.

You must believe yourselves, and you will do it.
Fake it, and then make it.

Now here comes my second warm-up game.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, please look around you and find a person
that you like. So we have pairs. Shake hands with your partner and maybe introduce
your names.

Each pair stand face to face and pull our both your hands. Each one of your two hands
should face each other, and your partner's hands are in the middle of the other one's
hands. Let me show you.

Yes, the four hands of each pair should like: hand-of-1|hand-of-2|hand-of-1|hand-of-2.

Now this line are birds, the other line are bears.

When you hear bird or birds, the birds will clap their hands and try to hit the bears.
So the bears will try to escape from the claps.

When you hear bear or bears, it's the time for the bears to clap, and for the bird to
escape.

Are you clear? Let's try once.

bird, bear.

OK. Now it's the real game time. I will tell you a story.

Long long time ago, there was a big mountain. At the bottom of the mountain there lived
lovely a bear. One day the bear comes out of its home and sees a big tree. There is a
beautiful bird in the tree.

Hi, bear, nice to meet you. said the bird.
Hi, bird, said the bear.

The Bear and the bird become best friends.

This is the end of the story. It's so easy. Right?

Is there anybody got hit?
Is there anybody always clap?
Is there anybody always escape?

You have think about it. Are you a person who wants to take risk, or are you a person
who wants to be safe?

So you see, a warm-up game will not only warm up your body, it also makes you think and
warms up your mind.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, at the end of the warm-up session. I want
to ask you

when there is a chance to be a club SAA, would you take it? We have games, and you can
help yourself and the other warm up their body and their mind. Even if you don't know
how to do it, you can just:

fake it until you make it

Now I would like to announce the meeting rules.

...

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, let clap our hands and welcome our president
to give the opening address.

Thank you.
