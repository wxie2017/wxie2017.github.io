Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

It is my honor and pleasure to be the General Evaluator of today's meeting.

General Evaluator, also known as GE, is an important meeting role in
Toastmasters meeting. As a GE, my responsibility is to observe the whole
meeting and give my comments at the end of the meeting. The evaluation will
not cover individual speeches, but rather point out the shining stars in the
meeting and recommend improvement based on my personal feeling.

There are three good partners for GE. They are Timer xxx, Ah-counter xxx, and
Grammarian xxx. We work together to evaluate today's meeting from different
perspectives.

First, let's welcome our Timer xxx to address the time rules.

Second, welcome our Ah-counter xxx to say a few words.

Last but not least, please welcome our grammarian xxx to teach us a lesson.

[applaud, shake hands]

We wish we all have a great meeting today.

Now back to TMD.
