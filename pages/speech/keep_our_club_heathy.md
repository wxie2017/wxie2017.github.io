Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

This is a level 4 project. It is about running a project, and it requires
2 speeches:

one 2- to 3-minute speech about the project plan, and
one 5- to 7-minute speech about the experience after completed the project.

Today, I will talk about the project plan.

First, the project is about "keep our club healthy".

On the road to good health, you might have heard this: an apple a day keeps
the doctor away. In the world of Toastmasters, the golden apple to keep a
club healthy is an inviting atmosphere with opportunities for leadership,
communication, and growth.

The three tenets of a healthy club are making sure members are engaged,
progressing through their goals, and most importantly, attending meetings.
There is not a specific “medicine” for assessing success. Just like people,
each club has different ways of measuring success. Some clubs have a
professional meeting tone, other clubs have a more relaxed vibe. Neither is
wrong, but the health of our club may rest in finding the right prescription.

So, to keep our club healthy, I want to run a project. Here I have to plans.

1. invite people to club meeting campaign
2. encourage mentor and mentee communication

Now I need your advice on which one will go.

I need 2- to 3-members as project members to help me in the project.

Here is the draft simple plan.
For project 1, the plan is each project member records the number of people
he invited to our club meeting in the next 4 meetings.

For project 2, the plan is each project member observes a pair of mentor-mentee,
and record their communication in the next 4 weeks.

Both projects' purpose is to increase club members' engagement.

Now which project are you in?

We will form a team for this project. There is not much budge for the project.
However, each project member will get a chance to talk on the stage during
the project. Finally we will reward the excellent members in our meeting.

This is my project plan. Members will discuss further in separate meetings.

Thank you.
