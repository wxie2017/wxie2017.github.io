Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Last Sunday many members including myself attended our club outing. We visited the Shanghai
Auto Museum. During this wonderful event, we discussed the topic of communication style.

Understanding one's communication style is a very interesting topic. By definition, communication
is a two-way process for reaching mutual understanding through verbal, non-verbal, and written
messages. Communication style is defined as the way in which individuals interact with one another
and the messages they send, intentionally or not, through their behaviors. Determining your own
communication style can help you improve how you share information with others. Learning how to
effectively communicate with styles different from your own will enable you to establish effective
relationships and create better understanding.

There are basically four kinds of communication style:
 - direct
 - initiating
 - supportive
 - analytical

Direct communicators prefer when you get to the point quickly and in a succinct manner. When dealing
with these communicators, be specific and avoid over-explaining or repeating yourself. Focus on
solutions and only provide details when asked. While people with direct communication style
is results-oriented, focused, and competitive, they are motivated to get things accomplished, they are
quick and decisive. Because they are independent and confident, they prefer a busy, efficient and
structured environment. Others may sometimes perceive them as impatient and demanding. So allowing
others to share feelings and explain details can encourage dialogue for direct communicators.

Initiating communicators value interacting with others and sharing stories. Allow time for socializing
at the beginning of meetings and create a friendly, non-threatening environment. Provide time for them
to express their feelings and opinions.

Supportive communicators appreciate a calm, steady approach. Earn their trust by providing them with
plenty of reassurance. When seeking their opinions and ideas, encourage them to express their concerns
and allow them time to make decisions. Because people with supportive communication style dislikes
change, they may appear indecisive. More often they are perceived as careful, patient, and amiable. Due
to their active listening skills, others see them as cooperative, dependable, and loyal. They are often
modest and prefers praise be given privately. Patient and slow-paced, they like a personal, relaxed,
no-tension environment. They put high priority on close relationships and do not like conflict, but
may mediate if necessary.

Analytical communicators like facts and figures. Present information to them in an organized manner and
be prepared to answer questions. Be patient while they think through and process new information.

While there are tools that can help you identify your communication styles, each communication style
has value and there is no best overall style. You may be comfortable using one style in many situations,
but is not necessarily what you choose in all communication.

It is important to recognize how effective communication can impact your interactions with others.
It can lead to higher efficiency and good morale in the workplace, increased innovation and creative
potential in groups, and satisfactory personal and familial relationships.

Communication styles are often situational. Be sure to monitor your application of communication styles.
Decide if your current style is effective based on feedback and outcomes. If necessary, adjust your
behavior and adopt new styles to fit a situation, team, or person.

There is much research and many theories about communication styles and their impacts. To develop a deeper
understanding, you may choose to do your own research.

I hope all of us can enjoy understanding ourselves' and other's communication style, so we can better
exchange ideas and feelings during outing or in the club.

Thank you.
