Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am glad to host the table topics session.

As the TMD said, today's topic is science. You may have read our poster.

The word “science” probably brings to mind many different pictures. Science includes
many diverse activities and topics.

Misconception: Science is a collection of facts.

Correction: Science is both a body of knowledge and the process for building that knowledge.

I am going to invite you come to stage one by one, and ask you a question.

The questions will be related to science. Your answer should be given to the audience. It is
better to explain your answer in a short speech. Your speech should be at least 1 minute
long and no longer than 2 minutes 30 seconds. Please pay attention to timer's card.

We have the work of today - "". You try to use it in your speech.

Who will be the first?

Q1: a fat textbook,

Q2: white lab coats and microscopes

Q3: an astronomer peering through a telescope

Q4: a naturalist in the rainforest

Q5: Einstein’s equations scribbled on a chalkboard

Q6: the launch of the space shuttle

Q7: bubbling beakers

Q8: Science is exciting.

Q9: Science is useful.

Q10: Science is ongoing.

Q11: Science is a global human endeavor.


I have a lot of fun watching your impromptu speech. You are all scientist.

Science is a way of discovering what’s in the universe and how those things work
today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future.
Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no
one has before.

Keep your curiosity.

Thank you. Back to TMD.
