Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

I have a question to ask you.
How many of you have a membership? Any membership, like Toastmasters
club member, like Cordis hotel member, or a restaurant member, or
fitness center member.

Ok. Most of us have. I have a few, too.

I am a Yu-Life Toastmasters club member. I have a credit card, which
I am the Platinum member. I am a China Southern Airline member. I am
a Burger King member, and so on and so forth.

Here comes the next question: why do we have so many membership?

Very good! We want benefits and the organizations want loyalty. The
membership program is so important that over 90% companies have
some kind of membership program.

It is also true in the non-profit world, like Toastmasters.

Today, my speech is about the Yu-Life Toastmasters club's membership
rewards program.

My speech is in the following parts:

1. A very brief introduction of Toastmasters organization

1.1 TI - D85 district - N area - N4 area - Yu-Life Club

1.2 Club members: officers + non-officers (6-month term)

1.3 Club meeting: SAA - TMD - GE + Timer/Ah-Counter/Grammarian
    - TTM/TTE - Sharing - member-only Prepared speecher - IE

2. A proposal of Yu-Life Club member rewards program

2.1 Why

As we see at the beginning, the goal of member rewards program
is to motivate club members to improve and build trust between
club and organization. Membership programs have proven
themselves as one of the most effective tactics for increasing
club members and inspiring member loyalty.

2.2 Categories

Points - Tier - Paid - Value

We choose Points based member rewards program. Points programs
are the most common type of rewards programs. These programs
let members accumulate points they can redeem for further benefits.
Members donâ€™t just earn points from speeches. They can also earn
points from inviting people, evaluation, being meeting officer, etc.

2.3 How

Education:
TMD/Timer/Ah-Counter/Grammarian - 10

2.4 Rewards

Points are valid as long as membership is continued.

We need a detailed financial analysis to create a reasonable
rewards program. As a non-profit organization, we have very
limited resource for monetized rewards. To do the program, we
have to find some other financial support. The below is just
my personal idea and it is open to discussion.

Free meeting entrance for one person - 200
5$ gift certificate in TI website    - 300
10$ gift certificate in TI website   - 500
15$ gift certificate in TI website   - 700
20$ gift certificate in TI website   - 800

With these certificates, you can buy gifts, books, tools
from Toastmasters shops.


3. Q&A

Let's quickly summarize what we have talked.

First we have learned that Toastmasters is non-profit educational
organization. Yu-Life club is one of Toastmasters clubs, which
offers its member the opportunity to learn communication and
leadership skills following Toastmasters educational system.

Second, I proposed a rewards program that is intended to encourage
our new and senior club members to continuously improve themselves
in the club.

I hope this will work for some people in some time. However, dear
fellow members and distinguished guests, when you find your long term
goal is to develop yourselves through a positive and supportive
group, you will find the value is not in the rewards program, the
value is in your personal growth and in your greater self-confidence.

Last but not least, I wish everyone could be motivated by her own
dream and stay loyalty in pursuing the dream. That way, we do not
necessarily need the rewards program.

Thank you.
