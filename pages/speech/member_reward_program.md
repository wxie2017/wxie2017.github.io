Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

I have a question to ask you.
How many of you have a membership? Any membership, like Toastmasters
club member, like Cordis hotel member, or a restaurant member, or
fitness center member.

Ok. Most of us have. I have a few, too.

I am a Yu-Life Toastmasters club member. I am a China Southern Airline
member. I am a Burger King member, and so on and so forth.

Here comes the next question: why do we have so many memberships?

Very good! We want benefits and the organizations want loyalty. The
membership program is so important that over 90% companies have
some kind of membership programs.

It is also true in the non-profit world, like Toastmasters.

Today, I want to propose a Yu-Life club member rewards program.

My speech is in the following parts:

1. A very brief introduction of Toastmasters organization

1.1 TI - Region - District D85 - Division N - Area 4 - Yu-Life Club

Region: 14

District: 106

Region 14 - D85: 江浙沪，安徽，武汉，湖南，江西

1.2 Club members: officers + non-officers (6-month term)

1.3 Club meeting: SAA - TMD - GE + Timer/Ah-Counter/Grammarian
    - TTM/TTE - Sharing - member-only Prepared speecher - IE

2. A proposal of Yu-Life Club member rewards program

2.1 Why

As we see at the beginning, the goal of member rewards program
is to motivate club members to improve and build trust between
members and the club. Membership programs have proven
themselves as one of the most effective tactics for increasing
club members and inspiring member loyalty.

Yu-Life club is a good club with all of you here, and we do not
have a member rewards program yet. Don't you think we need one?

Yes, we need one, a good one.

2.2 Categories

Points - Tier - Paid - Value

We choose Points based member rewards program. Points programs
are the most common type of rewards programs. These programs
let members accumulate points they can redeem for further benefits.
Members don’t just earn points from speeches. They can also earn
points from inviting people, evaluation, being meeting officer, etc.

2.3 How

Education|points
---------|------
TMD/Timer/Ah-Counter/Grammarian | 10
SAA/TTM/TTE/IE                  | 10
prepared speech                 | 15
GE                              | 15
finish one level                | 20
finish one path                 | 50

Social activity|points
---------------|------
attend meeting once             | 5
invite one friend               | 10
be a role in other clubs        | 10
attend area training            | 20
be a role in area meeting       | 50

Contest|points
-------|------
be a judge or role             | 10
join club contest              | 15
join area contest              | 30
join district contest          | 50

Here let's see an example.

Once I invited a friend and attended a club meeting together. In
the meeting, I delivered a prepared speech and also acted as an
Individual Evaluator.

Please calculate how many points I will get.

Activity | point
-------- | -----
attend a meeting          | 5
Invite a friend           | 10
deliver a prepared speech | 15
be an IE                  | 10
--------------------------|---
total                     | 40

So I will get 40 points after this meeting.

2.4 Rewards

Points are valid as long as membership is continued.

We need a detailed financial analysis to create a reasonable
rewards program. As a non-profit organization, we have very
limited resource for monetized rewards. To do the program, we
have to find some other financial support. The below is just
my personal idea and it is open to discussion.

Benefits|points
--------|------
Free meeting entrance for one person | 200
5$ gift certificate in TI website    | 300
10$ gift certificate in TI website   | 500
15$ gift certificate in TI website   | 700
20$ gift certificate in TI website   | 800

With these certificates, you can buy gifts, books, tools
from Toastmasters shops.


3. Q&A

Let's quickly summarize what we have talked.

First we have learned that Toastmasters is non-profit educational
organization. Yu-Life club is one of Toastmasters clubs, which
offers its member the opportunity to learn communication and
leadership skills following Toastmasters educational system.

Second, I proposed a rewards program that is intended to encourage
our new and senior club members to continuously improve themselves
in the club.

I hope this will work for some people in some time. However, dear
fellow members and distinguished guests, when you find your long term
goal is to develop yourselves through a positive and supportive
group, you will find the value is not in the rewards program, the
value is in your personal growth and in your greater self-confidence.

Last but not least, I wish everyone could be motivated by her own
dream and stay loyalty in pursuing the dream. That way, we do not
necessarily need the rewards program.

Thank you.
