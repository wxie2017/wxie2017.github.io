Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Social media has changed the way we live our lives. From the way we get our
news to the way we interact with our loved ones. Social media is everywhere.
It's powerful, it's unavoidable, and it's here to stay.

Many of you have at least one social media account. Who does not have a
Wechat account, please raise your hand.

I see each one here has a Wechat account.

Who also manage a Wechat public account? Please raise your hand. Good, you
are a social media experts.

[ask one of them] What's your big concern when you have a public account?

Numbers, right! Numbers are your biggest concern when you run a public
social media account.

I have been running my company's Wechat public account since the beginning
of 2020. Now 2021 is round the corner. I think it would be a great idea
to share some of the most important social media numbers. I hope the
information could provide you something to think about.

* number 1 - How often should you publish an article?

The Wechat public account is used to publish articles, photos, and videos, etc.
How many articles should I publish, daily, weekly or monthly? This is the
first social media marketing strategy question to ask.

Who has an idea of how often we should publish an article as a software
company?

Actually, we considered our capacity and decided that we would publish only
originally created articles once or twice a week, including company news.
This has been working right now.

* number 2 - number of followers

A social media account without followers is not worth much. The number of
followers is a very important indicator of a public account's influence.

Who can give a reasonable target of our followers target for 2020?
100? 200? 500?

Thank you for encouragement. It was much harder. We set our goals at 100,
and expecting to be 200 at the end of 2020. We made the first 100 followers
really quick in less than 2 months, we have about 120 followers in 2 months.
Most of them are our customers, partners and friends. The growth was very
slow afterwards. Guess, how many we have now? 169. It was also frustrating
that we lost a few along the way.

* number 3 - number of reads for articles

Apart from number of articles and number of followers, what do you think I
care? Yes, the number of reads. Do you have an idea of the most reads of our
articles? It's 129. We have 3 articles with over 100 reads, and one of them
is the company introduction. The average reads number is about 40, less than
1/4 of the followers.

* number 4 - the last number I care is the number of likes.

We all want praise from others, and it is really hard to win praise for a
social media account. We have published over 50 articles. Could you please
guess the likes for our articles?

The likes are so humble that it can be count with one hands.

I need a magic to make it.

In summary, although social media is becoming more integrated into our daily
lives, although it unveils countless opportunities for businesses who are
looking to reach out to their audience through social media marketing, it
is not free lunch. The numbers will not grow without investment, I do not
know how yet. I guess we should try influencer marketing or story ads sometimes.

Wish you all win big numbers in 2021.

Thank you.
