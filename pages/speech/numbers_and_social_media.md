Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Social media has changed the way we live our lives. From the way we get our
news to the way we interact with our loved ones. Social media is everywhere.
It’s unavoidable, it’s powerful, and it’s here to stay.

Many of you have a social media account, like Wechat account, right? Who does
not have, please raise your hand.

Who also manage a Wechat public account, or something similar? Good, I see
a few of you have.

[ask one of them] What's your big concern when you have a public account?

Ok.

I have been running my company's Wechat public account since the beginning
of 2020. Now 2021 is round the corner. we thought it would be a great idea
to share the most important social media statistics to keep in mind for 2021.
Staying on top of the latest social media statistics will help enhance your
marketing strategy and plan the interactions of your business with social
media. Let me share with you my experience.

Social media statistics from 2019 show that there are 3.5 billion social
media users worldwide, and this number is only growing. That equates to
about 45% of the current population (Emarsys, 2019). A company with social
media engagement is like person without a telephone.

However, when we first start the public account, when really just have very
simple idea of social media marketing strategy - numbers. How many articles
should we publish, daily, weekly or monthly? How many followers should we
have in a year?

Who has an idea of how often we should publish an article as a software
company?

Actually, we considered our capacity and decided that we would publish only
originally created articles once or twice a week, including company news.
This has been working right now.

Who can give a reasonable target of our followers target for 2020?
100? 200? 500?
Thank you for encouragement. It was much harder. We set our goals at 100,
and expecting to be 200 at the end of 2020. We made the first 100 followers
really quick in less than 2 months, we have about 120 followers in 2 months.
Most of them are our customers, partners and friends. The growth was very
slow aferwards. Guess, how many we have now? 169. It was also frustrating
that we lost a few along the way.

Apart from number of articles and number of followers, what do you think I
care? Yes, the number of reads and the number of likes. Do you have an idea
of the most reads of our articles? It's 129. We have 3 articles with over
100 reads, and one of them is the company introduction. The average reads
number is about 50, less than 1/3 of the followers.

The likes are so humble that it can be count with one hands.

In summary, although social media is becoming more integrated into our daily
lives, although it unveils countless opportunities for businesses who are
looking to reach out to their audience through social media marketing, it
is not free lunch. The numbers will not grow naturally, I do not how yet.
I guess we should try influencer marketing or story ads sometimes.

Thank you.
