Dear Fellow members,

Distinguished guests,

Happy new year!

We all had an unforgettable 2020 - there were a lot of things we should remember
for 2020. Right? The Pandemic, the lock-down, changing a job, finding a new boy
friend or girl friend, taking an important examination, etc.

For myself, I should remember that I joined Yulife Toastmasters club on the
1st of July, did my first Ice Breaker on July the 5th, got my first mentee on
18th October, finished my 1st Pathways level 4 on 17th December.

At last, to my surprise, I became the President of Yulife Toastmasters Club on
20th December. Thanks to all the members who haven't campaigned against me.

Although serving my club has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for
every single day, although I am very honored to be able to be an officer, the
role of club President is foreign to me. It is new to many of you, too.

I have fear and I have anxiety.

Have you ever felt fearful and anxious when you were pushed to a totally new
position? I guess we all have. Fear and anxiety are typical for our first
time journey just as we deliver our Ice Breaker speech in front the audience.

What should we do in this situation? I choose to be bold.

BOLD means brave, fearless in the face of danger.

Don't be afraid. Yulife club is safe. I guarantee that as the president.
We are all encouraged to do new things here and learn from the evaluations
we receive. All we need is to be bold.

BOLD means

Build it

Own it

Lead it

Deliver it.

* Build it

In the past, when we want something, we build it. Nowadays, we buy it.
However, there are things we cannot buy. For example, we cannot buy love,
relationships, we cannot even buy communication and leadership skills.
We have to build it.

Fortunately, the founders have built the Yulife Toastmasters club as a
stage for us to practice public speaking skills and improve leadership
skills.

We need build it further - either as club officers, meeting roles, or by
coming to the meetings, inviting friends to the meetings. Little by little,
We are building our club.

We discover our potential, and shape ourselves to be better.

The stage is already built. We are here to build better ourselves and
make future leaders, communicators.

If you know youâ€™ll need to sharpen your public speaking skills at some
point, why not do it early on and build it now?

* Own it

To build it is just the beginning. Ownership is the next step. We are
all here to practice our public speaking skills. Ownership gives us true
responsibility to move forward.

We own ourselves to start our Pathways, and we own ourselves to master
our own ideas. Whenever we deliver our thoughts clearly, we improve the
meeting quality in our club. Whenever we show our confidence on the stage,
we own the future of ourselves and we become the owner of our club.

* Lead it

When we become an owner, we become a natural leader.

To me, leadership starts with a commitment to principles which is
exactly an owner will do.

Communication skills, and public speaking skills in particular, are
a wild card to be leaders.

If we can articulate your ideas well in public and people will shower
us with credibility, we will be the leader.

* Deliver it

Last but not least, we deliver what we build, what we own and what
we lead.

In many situations, when we're the ones with the courage to speak up,
our ideas rise to the top. There's just something about delivering
a punchline in front of an audience that makes us smile on the inside.

Whether we are inspiring a group, presenting a solution to a problem,
or simply facilitating a discussion, our voice gets to be powerful.
We deliver the impact through your communication skills.

All in all, we all needed to be bold: build it, own it, lead it and
deliver it. Regardless of where our speaking skills are on the spectrum,
the best time to take the next step is right now.

Be bold.

Thank you.
