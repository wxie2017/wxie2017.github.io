Dear Fellow members,

Distinguished guests,

Happy new year!

We all had an unforgettable 2020 - there were a lot of things we should remember
for 2020. Right? The Pandemic, the lock-down, changing a job, finding a new boy
friend or girl friend, taking an important examination, etc.

For myself, I should remember that I joined Yulife Toastmasters club on the
1st of July, did my first Ice Breaker on July the 5th, got my first mentee on
18th October, finished my 1st Pathways level 4 on 17th December.

At last, to my surprise, I became the President of Yulife Toastmasters Club on
20th December. Thanks to all the members who haven't campaigned against me.

Although serving my club has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for
every single day, although I am very honored to be able to be an officer, the
role of club President is foreign to me. It is new to many of you, too.

I have fear and I have anxiety.

Have you ever felt fearful and anxious when you were pushed to a totally new
position? I guess we all have. Fear and anxiety are typical for our first
time journey just as we deliver our Ice Breaker speech in front the audience.

What should we do in this situation? I choose to be bold.

BOLD means brave, fearless in the face of danger.

Don't be afraid. Yulife club is safe, we are all encouraged to do new things
here and learn from the evaluations we receive. All we need is to be bold.

BOLD means

Build it

Own it

Lead it

Deliver it.

* Build it

In April 2012, Yulife Toastmasters club was founded with the slogan
Discover potential, shape ourselves.

The stage is already built. We are here to build better ourselves and
make future leaders, communicators.

When you recall the moment you join the club, didn't you want to discover
your potential on the stage? If you know you’ll need to sharpen your
public speaking skills at some point, why not do it early on and build it
now?

* Own it

Ownership is very important. We are all owners of our club. We are all
here to pratice our public speeking skills.

Speaking in public teaches you to master your own ideas. Whenever you
express yourself, whether verbally or in writing, your mental processes
become clearer. When we deliver our thoughts clearly, we improve the
meeting quality in our club. We show our confidence on the stage, and
we own the future of ourselves and we become the owner of our club.

* Lead it

To me, leadership starts with a commitment to principles。

I’ve seen many instances of leaders who lacked either character or
competence but gained credibility and respect based on their ability
to speak well in public.

Communication skills, and public speaking skills in particular, are
a wild card to be leaders.

If you can articulate your ideas well in public and people will shower
you with credibility, you will be the leader.

* Deliver it

In many situations, when you're the one with the courage to speak up,
your ideas rise to the top. There’s just something about delivering
a punchline in front of an audience that makes me smile on the inside.

Whether you are inspiring a group, presenting a solution to a problem,
or simply facilitating a discussion, your voice gets to be powerful.
You deliver the impact through your communication skills.

All in all, we all needed to be bold. Regardless of where our speaking
skills are on the spectrum, the best time to take the next step is right
now.

Be bold.

Thank you.
