Today's meeting is like attending a family dinner/luxury banquet /fancy restaurant dinner.

The SAA is the wonderful welcome man/lady. S/He uses friendly smile and interesting game to warm the guests up. Better deliver the meeting agenda.

The president is the respectful host. He is very professional and introduced the guests to the system very properly.

The TMD is like the host. She introduced every dishes to all of us with reminder of any change and and special taste.

The TTE is the great dishes like fried peanuts. She is hard but crystal clear about each and every details of every impromptu speakers. Her suggestion is very yummy.

The first IE is like spice meatball.

The second IE is like baked bread.

The three officers are large meals. The Timer is like cake, each one can only have her share no more. The Ah-counter is like a ginger addition, she took every error from each speaker. The grammarian is the fresh salad, she select the best of the best.

Last but not least, for this wonderful meeting we had to thank all the chief behind it. Their preparation is great.
