Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

I am excited to be here to give you my joining speech.

First of all, I sincerely thank Annabel and Justus for helping me go through all the
registration process. Finnally, I have got my member ID - 07788331. How exciting to
be part of the team!

Following our tradition, I will introduce myself and then talk about why I join Toastmaster.

I am an experienced engineer and manager, and now I am running my own software company.
When you have any software requirement, you can come to me. I am glad to help.

I am happlily married, and we have a lovely son who just took his high school entrance
examination last week. We hope he can enter his ideal middle school and begin his new
period of life.

I like sports very much. I used to play football very often in my spare time. Now I go
to swim every week.

So much for my self-introduction. But of course we can talk more about this during our social
time.

People have various reasons to join Toastmaster. The reason I join Toastmaster is very simple:

I want to be a public speaker.

For years I have been learning from a lot of great minds, and I have come across many
great ideas. Some of the ideas are so inspiring and so important that I cannot help
myself sharing the ideas with others, with a lot of people.

The best way to share ideas, for me, is to become a public speaker. A public speaker
can spread ideas broadly and inspire people efficiently.

Toastmasters International is a non-profit educational organization that teaches public
speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs. The organization's
membership exceeds 358,000 in more than 16,800 clubs in 143 countries. Since 1924,
Toastmasters International has helped people from diverse backgrounds become more
confident speakers, communicators, and leaders. So I am joining Toastmaster.

Yu-life club is wonderful club to join because of her cozy environment we all feel,
and because of the kind, warm-hearted members like each and everyone of you. So I am
joining Yu-life.

Dear President, dear fellow members, please vote for me.

Together, we spread great ideas. Togehter, we make our planet a better place.

Thank you.
