Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

I am excited to be here to give you my joining speech.

First of all, I sincerely thank Annabel and Justus for helping me go through all the
registration process. Finnally, I have got my member ID - 007788331. How exciting to
be part of the team!

Following our tradition, I will introduce myself and then talk about why I join Toast-
master.

I am an experienced engineer and manager, and now I am running my own software company.
When you have any software requirement, you can come to me. I am glad to help.

I am happlily married, and we have a lovely son who just took his high school entrance
examination last week. We hope he can enter his ideal middle school and begin his new
period of life.

I like sports very much. I used to play football very often. Now I go to swim every week.

So much for my self-introduction. Of course we can talk more about this during our social
time.

People have various reasons to join Toastmaster. The reason I join Toastmaster is very simple:

I want to be a public speaker.

For years I have been learning from a lot of great minds, and I have come across many
great ideas. Some of the ideas are so inspiring and so important that I cannot help
myself to share the ideas with others, with a lot of people.

The best way to share ideas, for me, is to become a public speaker. Toastmaster is a
leading orgnization to develop public speech skills. So I am joining Toastmaster, and
I believe Yu-Life club is the best club for me to grow, so I am joining Yu-life.

Together, we spread great ideas. Togehter, we make our planet a better place for our
children.

Thank you.
