Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am glad to host the table topics session.

As the TMD said, today's topic is cooking. May I ask you: do you cook?

Ok, I am relaxed. Most of you do cook.

I am going to invite you come to stage one by one, and ask you a question.

The questions will be related to cook. Your answer should be given to the audience. It is
better to explain your answer in a short speech. Your speech should be at least 1 minute
long and no longer than 2 minutes 30 seconds. Please pay attention to timer's card.

We have the work of today - "". You try to use it in your speech.

Who will be the first chief?

Q1: Cooking is as old as civilization itself. Image that you meet your ancestors in the old
time when they know nothing about cooking. Which cooking method will you teach them?

Q2: Many have perceived cooking as both an art and a science. What is the most
impressive cooking experience for you?

Q3: Cooking makes food more digestible, so the calories and some of the nutrients
in them are easier to absorb. How would you cook a delicious head of lions?

Q4: Cooking foods can preserve them so we can have food in winter. What is your
favorite stored food?

Q5: In most traditional societies, the task of daily food preparation fell primarily
to women. How would you appreciate your mam when she did a good meal for the family?

Q6: Cooking sometimes brings people together, and win friendship or love. What have/will
you cook for your girl/boyfriend the first time?

Q7: Cooking becomes a profession, and have a name called cuisine. Imagine your are
in a fancy restaurant. How would like them to serve you?

Q8: Sweeping views of history, patterns in cuisine are always simplified. What's
your opinion on the so-call Chinese cooking and western cooking?

Q9: Some ingredients are very important in cooking even if you only need a little of
them. If life a meal, which ingredients would you add to your life.

Q10: Living in a metropolis, cooking is almost a lost art for young people.
How would you encourage self-cooking?

I have a lot of fun watching your impromptu speech. You are big chefs.

Cooking can make us healthier, make our family more united, and make our world
more delicious. I hope next time you can bring your even more wonderful stories
about cooking.

Enjoy cooking, and enjoy life.

Thank you. Back to TMD.
