Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will host the table topic session.

This is a session that we encourage everyone to come to the stage to enjoy speaking
to the public.

There are 8 rules here, a lot but very simple.

1. When you come to the stage, we shake hands first with smiles, of course.

2. Then I will ask you a question about today's TableTopics.

3. You speak out the question, think about it for 10 seconds, then deliver
a speech as the answer.

4. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

5. One of the audience could challenge you with a question.

6. You can answer that question, too.

7. Please write down your name on the white board after your speech.

8. We shake hands and you can go back to sit.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

As you have read in our agenda, the TableTopics is emoji.
Could anyone explain this word?

The first emoji were created in 1999 by Japanese artist Shigetaka Kurita.
Emoji is a Japanese word that translates in English as "e" for "picture" and "moji" for "character."

    :) is a smile
    ;) is a wink
    :P is a tease or sticking your tongue out
    :O is surprised or a gasp
    :( is unhappy
    :'( is really sad or crying
    :D is a big smile
    :| is a flat expression for I feel nothing
    :X is for my lips are sealed
    O:) is for a happy face with a halo, meaning I'm extra good and happy

Now who wants to be the first to come to the stage?


Q1. Here are 3 emojis: :'( , :D , :) . Please choose one and explain it to the audience.


Q2. What's your favorite emoji? Please do a gesture for it and tell us why you like it?


Q3. If you are not familiar with an emoji people messaged you, what would you do?


Q4. People tend to use a lot emojis in social media, what's your thought on this?


Q5. Would you pay to get some emojis? What's the reason for that?


Q6. Some day in the future, People can contact with aliens, but we can only send
an emoji a time. What will be the first emoji you want to send?


Our normal communication including speech is full of emotion and playfulness, which
is hard to express in written text. This is the situation that emojis come in. We
can use them to express the thing that words cannot do. Use emojis wisely can help
improve our communication.


Thank you.
