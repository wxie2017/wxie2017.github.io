Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Standing standing on the stage, my heartbeat is over 100 times/minute.
I have fear. I feel nervous.

Have you ever felt the same? Do you have a good way to control your
emotion?

Recently I have recorded my major emotional reactions to others. There
were some emotional moments.

On the morning of 22nd, March, I read the news about Richard Stallman's
reinstate in Free Software Foundation.


On the afternoon of 24th, March, I got an email about supporting Richard
Stallman.


Thank you.
