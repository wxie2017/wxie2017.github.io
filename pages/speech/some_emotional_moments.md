Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Standing on the stage, my heartbeat is over 100 times/minute.
I have fear. I feel nervous.

Have you ever felt the same? Do you have a good way to control your
emotions?

Recently I have recorded my major emotional reactions to others. There
were some emotional moments.

Let me share with you one of them.

On the morning of 22nd, March, I read the news about Richard Stallman's
reinstatement in Free Software Foundation. I was very excited and shared
this with many friends, and most of them were glad, too.

This was the joyful moment. I felt relaxed when I share information with
people.

Richard Stallman is the founder of Free Software Foundation, and was the
long time president of the Foundation. He has been devoting his life to
the Free Software movement.

In 2019, because of some deliberate misinterpretation of his words. He
was forced to resign from MIT and FSF. That was a very shocked and sad
moment.

His return for me is of course a good news. However, on the afternoon of
24th, March, I got an email about supporting Richard Stallman.

What was wrong?

Because of his return, some people began to attack Richard Stallman again.
They were organized. They published an open letter, which is full of
mistakes. Their purpose is to stop Richard Stallman from backing to FSF.

I wrote an email to the FSF board of directors to support Richard Stallman.
I also involved in debates in some group to defend my opinion.

Some debate was very emotional. Both parties used strong words and wrote
very long posts. The debates become endless. I have read a thread of over 100
posts.

This is the doubtful and angry moment. I felt frutrated and wanted to have a
face-to-face confront.

In the time of internet, a large portion of our time is spent online, often
not face-to-face. Emotional Intelligence is still important under this new
situation.

Without facing each other, we may tend to be less vulnerable to anxiety.
However, we may become more word-voilent, less self-awareness and less self-
regulation. We tend to attack each other more often. This is very bad.

In the network, most of us still want a good virtual world. We still want to
respect and to be respected. Recognizing my emotions and developing self-
awareness is still very important. If we understand our emotion more, we
could understand our response more and can make a better virtual world.

Wish you all enjoy every moment of your life with more emotional intelligence,
whether online or offline.

Thank you.
