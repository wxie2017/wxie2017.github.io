Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

It is June 6, and it is our 361st meeting today. 6x6 = 36 plus a little bit love,
we have 361. This is our luck. I wish you all win something with that luck.

Today I will host the table topic session.

This is a session that we encourage everyone to come to the stage to enjoy speaking
to the public.

There are 6 rules here, a lot but very simple.

1. When you come to the stage, we shake hands first with smiles, of course.

2. Then I will ask a question to you around today's TableTopics.

3. You could think about the question for 10 seconds, then deliver a speech as the
answer.

4. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

5. Please write down your name on the white board after your speech.

6. We shake hands and you can go back to sit.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

As you have read in our agenda, the TableTopics is nastalgia. Could
anyone explain this word?

Yes, it is a noun, means homesickness. It also means a feeling of
pleasure and also slight sadness when you think about things that
happened in the past:

Some people feel nostalgia for their schooldays.

Hearing that song again filled him with nostalgia.

Now who wants to be the first to come to the stage?

1. What's your recollection of the first time you experienced the
feeling of nostalgia?

I did not know what nostalgia meant until my early twenties...

2. Do you think nostalgia is emotion or memory?

Most people would consider nostalgia to be a connection with good
memories of the past. However, it is clear that nostalgia has
little to do with memories themselves. The feeling of nostalgia
is actually related to emotional states, not memories.

3. What do you think is the root of nostalgia?

I think nostalgia comes from our need for belonging. This is an
essential human need.

4. When you find yourself in the throes of romanticizing or longing
for the past, what do you do? For example, do you try to ground
yourself in the present or release those emotions? Do you let them
flow through you?

I never shake it off, no matter how uncomfortable.

5. How living abroad has affected your relationship with nostalgia,
if at all?

There really is a strong connection between nostalgia and oneâ€™s
homeland.

Thank you for sharing your experience.I also think nostalgia comes
from a true appreciation of life.

Dear audience, is the Earth your home planet? Yes for sure.
Is China your home country? Is Shanghai your hometown?
Is Yu-Life your home club?

When we realize just how temporary everything is, we want to
hold on to what we consider our best moments. And it is these
moments that fill us with gratitude for being alive, able to
experience such an intensity of emotions.

Enjoy the nastalgia. Enjoy the life.

Thank you.
