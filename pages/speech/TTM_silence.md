Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am glad to host the table topics session, and I want you to be the Master.

Many of you know that in Toastmasters there is an achievement, called (what) DTM, not TMD.
What does DTM mean? Don't talk much.

When we do public speech, we don't know how to talk, but often you don't need to talk, your
silence and body languages, facial expressions and eye contact can be more powerful than words.

Today I am going to invite you come to stage one by one, and ask you a question.

You should give your answer only using your body languages, facial expressions and eye contact.
You can only talk when you use the word of today in your sentence.

I know you can do it. Let's go. You have at least 1 minute to do it.

Here comes the first master.

Q1: How do you feel when you do the nucleic acid sampling?

Q2: Why is it so hard to get up in a Sunday morning?

Q3: What would you do when you receiving followers from your loved ones?

Q4: How would you react to a mosquito?

Q5: What fruit do you enjoy most in summer?

Q6: How would you open a paper letter from your dream school?

Q7: What is your experience/imagination in learning swimming?

Q8: How do you quarrel with your father/mother over the phone?

Q9: What would you do to your pet (dog, cat)?

Q10: How to say goodbye to group of people?

I have a lot of fun watching your impromptu speech. You are the masters in body language.

You see, you can use your talent to show the idea without speaking out. That's
the magic of your body, your hands, your eyes and your faces.

Practice. You will be the masters of your body.

Thank you. Back to TMD.
