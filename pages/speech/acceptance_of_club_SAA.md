Respectful president,
Fellow memebers,

Thank you for nominating me as the Sergeant At Arms.
I am so honored to be standing here today to become a club officer. Serving my
club has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for every single day.
I wouldn't be able to do it if it weren't for all the amazing people in this
club and around my life.

Firstly, I sincerely thank our club Present President, Amanda. She always come
to the club earlier than me, and has done all the job for SAA. Please leave me
some work, president, I am now the SAA.

Secondly, I give my heartful thanks to another president, our Past President,
Annabel. She is also my mentor. I still remember that after I became a member,
she invited me to join the district training. There was also a SAA in the training,
the SAA is a lady, and she was smiling and asking me: which officer are you?
You know, I really don't know. Annabel told me to put SAA. I think I am the
club SAA from that moment unconsciously. Thank you, Annabel.

I would also like to thank all the members to give me trust and support. Your
hard work makes the job of SAA so easy. Thank you.

Lastly, I would like to thank my wife and my son. They are not here right now.
Without my family's love and support, I would not be able to do such an interesting
job as SAA. I would be shopping with my wife, cooking for my son and so on.

As a Sergeant At Arms, SAA, my major job is to welcome everybody to the club, prepare
the meeting facilities, test the meeting devices, give the first speech in the meeting,
and clean up the place after the meeting. I will do my best to make all of you feel
comfortable before the meeting, in the meeting and after the meeting.

I want to continue hearing your ideas, getting your feedback, and finding out more
ways to serve you better. To that end, please let me know whenever you have suggestions
and feel free to tell me what you are thinking.

But most of all, thank you all for using your speeches, your vocal varieties, and your
eye contacts to express your confidence in me. Thank you for the opportunity to serve
you.

SAA means Xie Always Armed.

Thank you.
