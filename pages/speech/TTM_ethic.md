Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will host the table topic session. This is a session that we encourage everyone
to come to the stage to enjoy speaking to the public.

There are 2 rules here.

1. When you come to the stage, please write down your name on the white board first.

2. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

Today, we will talk about the topic of ethic. E-T-H-I-C. Raise your hands if you do
know its meaning. (Ask someone to explain.)

(Thank you.)

This is not a word that we use everyday. However, this is a word that we should all
have. Once the great philosophier Kant said: two things fill the mind with ever new
and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily we reflect on them:
the starry heaven above me and the moral law within me. Here the moral law is ethics.

Today, we look at the blue beatiful sky over our heads and the green grass under over
feet. Let's answer some simple questions. Let's see if we feel good to do good things,
and feel bad to do bad things.

First, I describe a situation. A business owner has ordered 10 computers for your stuff.
The deliver company dellivers 10 computers. However, their money on the invoice to pay
is only for nine computers. This is a mistake that is very unlikely to be find in the
future.

Now you understand the situation, right? I have 2 questions for this situation.
Who wants to be the first?

Q1 Using 1 to 10 to say how likely you think the business owner will inform the
deliver company about the mistake and why?

Q2 Suppose you are the business. Using 1 to 10 to say how likely you will inform
the deliver company about the mistake and why?

Second, you come to today's Toastmasters meeting and enjoy it. After the meeting,
you find that you lost an envolop. There is 100 kuai in the envolop and there is
also name and address on it. A stranger finds the envolop.

I also have 2 questions about this situantion. Now who wants to answer the first
question?

Q3 Using 1 to 10 to say how likely you think the stranger will return the envolop
to you and why?

Q4 Suppose you are the stranger. Using 1 to 10 to say how likely you will return
the envolop and why?

Now I will ask some normal questions. Who wants to be the next great speakers?

Q5. Is it ever ok to lie and why?

Q6. What is the best way to distribute limited resources? For example, water, food.

Q7. We know that there is war in Gaza right now. What's your opinion about Isereal's
action?

Q8. What is the most ethical way for you to donate 1,000,000 RMB?

Q9. If technology becomes available, would you edit your children's genomes and why?

Q10. Should we actively limit the population on the Earth and why?

Q11. If you neibough's wifi has no password, would use it and why?

Q12. Does humanity have to right to clonize other planets?

Q13. Should prisoner be used for labor and why?

Q14. Should healthcare be privatized and why?

Q15. Is it ethical to hire someone to do assignments for you and why?

Q16. Should all software be free and why?

Thank you very much for answering my questions. I have learned a lot.

Many of us think about ethical questions now and then, but it is not often that
we sit down and ponder these questions in depth. However, doing this can be a
great way to open up conversions with people around you and gain deeper insight
about our moral delimmas.

I hope you all enjoy a peaceful and ethical life when you look up the starry sky
and look into your own mind.

Thank you.
