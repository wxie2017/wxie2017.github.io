Dear Audience, Fellow members,

Good evening.

After hearing Siting's speech on leadership style, I feel that I need to do
this project one more time because she has finished it so well. Let us give
her another round of applaud.

Let me try to summarize what she has done excellently using three characters:

ALC

These characters are not Air Liquid China.

A for attitude

L for logic

and C for connection

As for attitude, I mean Siting is very serious about her speech. She contacted
me as soon as she knew that I was going to be her IE, and sent me the purpose
of her speech and the self-assessment of her leadership style. She also asked
if I had done this project. You see, she is learning the audience. These are
the right attitude for prepared speech. It help her to deliver the speech fluently
and timely. I hope she can keep this big A.

About L, logic, I find that Siting's speech is well-structured with an opening
of main point, 2 to 3 stories to support the main point, and a closing summary.
This is the easiest way for level to project. I like the opening particularly,
it is interesting/powerful with questions. We should all remember this L.

Then I have the C for connection. I noticed that Siting's speech not only connects
to the purpose of this project, but also connects to the audience. She used many
body languages, vocal varieties to get the audience's attention. For example, she
called for ... I think her connection made the speech interesting to her audience.
This is the big C.

I am critical person. I noticed that her eye contact with me is not enough. I don't
know if it is the same to you. If she could divide her eye contact to each and every
attendees tonight, the speech would be more meaningful. Anyway, leadership is an
important skill we all need.

In summary, Siting has done a good speech with right attitude, good logic and effective
connection. I believe this is a qualified level-2 speech. Congratulation to Siting.

Thank you.
