  大家晚上好！我希望大家和我一样，对即将开始的学习之旅感到兴奋和期待。我叫老獬，
  在接下来 10 天的课程中，我是两位学员的陪伴者和引导者。

  我 2020 年加入上海 Yu－Life 头马俱乐部，算起来马龄近 4 年。我在第 5 期和第 6 期的
  训练营中都做了导师，有幸和勤劳的营长、认真的教练大田以及 4 位优秀学员合作过。他们在演讲
  方面的出色表现磨练了我的点评技能。众导师热衷于分享知识和导师之导师 Rocky 的最佳实践点
  评也赋能于我，让我助力学员在演讲中出类拔萃。

  在我多年的系统软件工程师的职业生涯中，我了解到持续学习是成功的基石，这正是我们今天在这里
  要做的事情。无论你是希望提升技能，采纳新策略，还是简单地获得新视角，我都愿意在这里帮助你
  成长。

  未来有 10 天课程，我鼓励大家，特别是我的两位学员，积极提问，分享经验，并准时打卡完成作业。
  这是一个学习和创新的安全空间，你们可以尽情发挥自己的个性和潜力。

  让我们把这个训练营变成多彩互动的头马 N 中区最佳学习体验。我是老獬，很高兴与你们一起进行
  这次教育之旅。我已就绪，你准备好了吗？

  Good evening, everyone! I hope you're all as excited as I am to embark on
  this learning journey together. My name is lao xie, and I'll be your guide
  and evaluator over the next 10 days of the course.

  With over 3 years of experience in Toastmasters club, I've had the privilege
  of being an evaluator in the previous 5th and 6th training campaign, where
  I've honed my skills in evaluating 4 learners speeches. I, myself, have
  been impressed by many other trainers as well as the campaign leaders.
  I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and best practices that can empower
  professionals like yourselves to excel in your roles.

  Throughout my career as a system software developer, I've learned that
  continuous learning is the cornerstone of success, and that's exactly what
  we're here to do. Whether you're looking to sharpen your skills, adopt new
  strategies, or simply gain a fresh perspective, I'm here to facilitate that
  growth.

  During our time together, I encourage you to ask questions, share experiences,
  and engage actively. This is a safe space for learning and innovation, and
  your insights are invaluable.

  Let's make this session interactive and enriching for all. Once again, I'm
  lao xie, and I'm thrilled to be on this educational adventure with you.
  Let's get started!
