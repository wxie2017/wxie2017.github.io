---


Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

A question to the members, how many of you start your Pathways?

My first Pathways is Presentation Mastery, in which I experienced the
wonderful world of how to deliver a good public speech.

Who chose this one? Trust me, it is worth the effort.

My second Pathways is a gift from Toastmasters International
because it cost me nothing. It was given gratis to members
during the pandemic. This implies that the organization cares
about its members. I get the impression that stay with Toastmasters,
Pathways open.

I chose Motivational Strategies for my second Pathways. I have done
the required projects and speeches.

What is the most important thing to do when you finish a task?

Yes, review the lessons learned, so the last thing you do for
your Pathways is to reflect.

Today I am going to review my second completed Pathways, and I
want to tell you that stay with Toastmasters, Pathways open.

My review consists of the following four parts:

1. my accomplishments in Toastmasters

2. my accomplishments outside of Toastmasters

3. the impact of being a Toastmasters

4. next steps

## my accomplishments in Toastmasters


For this Pathways, I have done about 13 prepared speeches already, and
some I have to do more than once because we have very strict evaluators.

I have accomplished the following projects:

level 1|
-------|
project 1 | Ice Breaker: Bold
project 2 | Evaluation and Feedback
project 3 | Research and Present

level 2|
-------|
project 1 | Understand Your Communication Style: Be Nice
project 2 | Active Listening
project 3 | Introduction to Toastmasters Mentor

level 3|
-------|
project 1 | Understanding Emotional Intelligence: Some Emotional Moments
project 2 | Inspire Your Audience: Keep our club healthy
project 3 | Effective Body Language:

level 4|
-------|
project 1 | Motivate Others: Pull the Trigger
project 2 | Question and Answer Session: Copyright - past, present, future

level 5|
-------|
project 1 | Team Building: Is project management against human nature?
project 2 | Prepare to Speak Professionally: Member Rewards Program


The first Ice Breaker may be easy, but how about a second Ice Breaker?
How would you choose your second introduction? I did a speech titled
"Bold". Who still remember the meaning of bold? That was my new year's
resolution for 2021.

So you can always find a topic to talk.

The whole Pathways is a great training:

writing the speech, practicing the speech, delivering the speech, receiving
feedback, implementing feedback in the next speech. My communication skills
have been improved dramatically.

In one sentence, it is worth the effort.


## my accomplishments outside of Toastmasters

When I have done a lot speeches in our club following the Pathways. Something
happens to my life.

I began to express my thoughts in a systematic way. I say my points with
supporting material and stress my ideas at the end.

I began to get the habit of evaluate the speeches I hear. Do they have a
clear main point? Do they have a well-structured content? How do the speakers
use gestures, facial expression and vocal varieties to convey their main
point? These help me a lot in learning and understanding.

The communication skills also make my family life much better because I
know the benefit of positive and supportive talk. I listen actively and
always find the shining points of the other parties. I feel the power
of encouragement.


## the impact of being a Toastmasters

It is good to be a Toastmasters.

I always tell people that in Toastmasters club you will meet only good
human beings, and this makes me feel sound and safe, this makes me want
to be one of them. This is the sense of belonging.

I feel confident to speak in front of a large group of people. When there
was chance to give a speech to the students to my son's school, I did
not hesitate to nominate myself. The speech was successful, and it made
my son be proud.

You see, being a Toastmaster not only offers you chance to meet good
friends, but also opens many paths in your life.


## next steps

What is my next steps?

I want to keep this journey further.

I need improve in many aspects, and I want to work with all club members
together to experience the wonderfulness of standing on the stage
confidently. I want we all enjoy the power of sharing the beauty of
knowledge of human kind, because

Stay with Toastmasters, Pathways open.


Thank you.
