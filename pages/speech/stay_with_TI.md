---


Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

A question to the members, how many of you start your Pathways?

My first Pathways is Presentation Mastery, in which I experienced the
wonderful world of how to deliver a good public speech.

Who chosed this one? Trust me, it is worth the effort.

My second Pathways is a gift from Toastmasters International
because it cost me nothing. It was given gratis to memebers
during the pandemic. This implies that the organization cares
about its members. I get the impression that stay with Toastmasers,
Pathways open.

I chosed Motivational Strategies for my second Pathways.

Today I am going to review my second completed Pathways.

My review consists of the following four parts:

1. my accomplishments in Toastmasters

2. my accomplishments outside of Toastmasters

3. the impact of being a Toastmasters

4. next steps

## my accomplishments in Toastmasters

Pathways Reflection|
-------------------|

The hardest thing was to start. That's where the mentor comes in. My mentor
reminded me to start my IceBreaker.

The Toastmasters official web site is your best place to kick off your
Pathways.

Dear audience, have you ever opened the web site? Do you still remember the
www.toastmaster.org? Do you still remember your member ID and password?

IceBreaker is the first project of your level 1 in Pathways. It was not hard
for me. I can do a 5- to 7-minute self-introduction. I hope you can do this,
too. If not, your mentor has a lot of experience on this.

Of course, a whole Pathways consists of many projects. I have done 20 speeches
along the ways and I have attended 41 club meetings. The D85 passport is a
great tool to help me record my Pathways and club activities. Have you got one?
Have you record your Pathways in it? If not, do it today.

The whole Pathways is a great training:
writing the speech, practicing the speech, delivering the speech, receiving
feedback, implementing feedback in the next speech. My communication skills
have been improved dramatically.

I was so excited that I delivered my first sharing after I finished level 1.
I see many happy faces there. I was so confident that I began to visit other
clubs and challenged myself in different stages. The feeling is fantastic.

In one sentence, it is worth the effort.


## my accomplishments outside of Toastmasters


## the impact of being a Toastmasters

## next steps

Stay with Toastmasters, Pathways open.

I was wondering:
dear members of Yu-Life club, I miss you on the stage.
If I can do it, you can do it, too.
All you need is to come here on the stage.

Thank you.
