Look around you and tell me what you see.

Books. Yes, we are in a book store, and there are many books here.

Are we allowed to read these books? Do we have the right to read them?

Am I kidding to ask this question?

No, of course not.

Dear contest chair, dear fellow toastmasters,

we all have the right to read. It is one of the foundations of a democratic
society. Reading allows us to meet people, to debate philosophies, and to experience events
far beyond the narrow confines of our own existence. Reading books also gives us a lot of fun,
and reading is particularly important during the time of pandemic when our mouths become privacy
and our eyes can still open.

Raise your hand if you have ever bought a book from a bookstore.

Many of you have. I have, too.

Not long ago, I bought the paper version of Hong Lou Meng for my son. It is a classic novel,
and I enjoy reading it, too. And I can lend the book to others, too, if they also like
it. I can lend it to as many people as I like.

Raise your hand if you have ever lent a book to others.

Many of you have. It is because we own the book we bought, and no one can forbid us to lend
the book.  We all have the right to read, and we all have the right to share.

However, if I ever had an e-reader like this, and bought the e-version of Hong Lou Meng,
most likely, I would not be able to lend it to others - this is not allowed.

Maybe you can say that why not get a copy of the book from the e-reader. If I had ever
figured out how to get a copy of my Hong Lou Meng from the e-reader and sent it to my
friends, my friends' e-reader would simply refuse to open the copy - it would not work:
because the software in the e-reader has malicious features called Digital Right Management,
we call it Digital Restrictions Management (DRM, for short) to forbid the sharing.
The e-books are on-purposely designed like this so that only that particular software
with that malicious functionality can display them.

This is a denial to the individual's right to read, a denial to our right to share.

If these policies were limited to one company, we'd bypass them, but the other e-reader
dealers' policies are roughly similar.

Raise you hand if you have a wechat group.

Many of you have. I have many wechat groups.

Once a group member sent a message in the group and asked - how do you like the article
I shared? I was wondering - I had not seen the article. Could you share it again?
The member sent a screenshot for his chat history - the article was shared. However,
only he, himself could see it in the group. All the other members saw nothing. The
shared article was blocked.

Ladies and Gentlemen, it doesn't have to be this way. Reading is fun, sharing is
good. Reading and sharing ought to be legal, and preventing sharing
by restricting readers is unethical. We must demand our right to read and share.

Look around you. We still have the same old freedoms in using paper books and other
analog media. But if e-books replace printed books, those freedoms will
not transfer.

How would you feel if someday you are only allowed to read the books you bought
for just one time?

How would you feel if someday your children are not allowed to share books with you?

How would you feel if someday you are not allowed to read without having an e-reader
to track you?

I feel very frustrated. We all have the right to read and share,
but we all face the danger to be deprived of it.

It's time to fight for our right to read, and it is time to defend our right to share.

Are you ready?

Back to contest chair.
