You’re in good company. With more than 15,800 clubs worldwide and
seven officer positions for each club, that’s potentially 110,600
leaders! Maybe you’re like I was, a bit intimidated, especially if
you are a first-time officer. Relax! You still have Lao-xie at the
disposal, and my help is always available.

Here are my Advice for All Club Officers

The seven nominated club officer positions are president, vice
president education, vice president membership, vice president
public relations, sergeant at arms, treasurer and secretary. The
responsibilities for each role are specific, though they may
over-lap or require cooperation between two or more officers.
To make the term successful, consider these suggestions.

1. Attend club officer training

This training is developed by Toastmasters International and
conducted by our district leaders.

2. Do some self-training

Read the Club Leadership Handbook. Explore www.toastmasters.org
for the resources.

3. Seek mentoring from former officers

Ideally, meet with your immediate predecessor, to make a smooth
transition.

4. Just do it

In Toastmasters you “learn by doing.” Don’t fear making a mistake.
Most mistakes can be corrected. Take your role seriously enough
to commit to it but lightly enough to allow yourself some slack
if something goes wrong.

5. Resist doing another officer’s job

While some roles overlap, clearly define where your
responsibilities end and where another officer’s begins. This is
the hard part, bu please communicate, coordinate and delegate.

6. Attend club officer meetings

Even if you think your role is quiet or not visible, the other
officers should know the status of your efforts.

7. Enlist an assistant or team

When the workload increases or if you will be unavailable to
perform your duties. The benefit? You train a successor in the process!

Seven pieces of advice for seven new club officers. I hope this is
not too much. Now let welcome our new president, the Chief Executive
Officer of the club, Wu Zhong who is responsible for the club’s
overall operation, to give his address.

Welcome President Wu Zhong.
