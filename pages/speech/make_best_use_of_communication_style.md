Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

We all know that communication is very important for our study, career and life. Becoming better
communicators need learn and practice. In Toastmasters there are many ways to help you improve
your communication skills. Determining your own communication style and make the best use of it
is one of them.

Communication style is how you interact with others and how you deliver messages. There are
basically four kinds of communication style:

 - direct
 - initiating
 - supportive
 - analytical

Toastmasters' website provides a real situation evaluation tool, which can help you determine
your own communicat style. It shows you a commnication situation, and ask you how to handle.
I think it is very scientific and can give you a good judgement.

I have done my assessment. Most of my points are from supportive communication style, and a few
are from direct style. So I know that I am largely a supportive communicator.

Supportive communicators appreciate a calm, steady approach. In your eyes, I may look like a careful,
patient and amiable person. These are the typical characters of a supportive communicator. I dislike
change and sometimes seem indicisive, and I like the personal, relaxed, no-tension environment as we
have in Yu-life club. I am often an active listener, and you may see me as cooperative, dependable,
and loyal, so you can come to me whenever you want to talk. If you want to praise me, please do so
more privately. I will try to avoid any conlict and prefer close relationships with each other.

Because I am also a little direct - that's the other side of the coin, sometimes I prefer when you get
to the point quickly and in a succinct manner. This means that I am results-oriented, focused, and
competitive. I am motivated to get things accomplished. When I am showing quick actions and demanding
attitude, please remind me my supportive side, so that I will allow you to share feelings and
explain details.

Each communication style has value and there is no best overall style. I may be comfortable using
supportive style in many situations, but it is not necessarily what I choose in all communication.
Communication styles are often situational. I can be directive sometimes. However, I will monitor my
communication styles based on your feedback. If necessary, I will adjust my behavior and adopt new
styles to fit a situation, team, or person.

I hope all of you now understand my communication style, and can make the best use of the tips to
communicate with me. You can also assess your communication style and make the best use of it, so that
we can exchange ideas and feelings much better.

Thank you.
