Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

We all know that communication is very important for our study, career and life. Becoming better
communicators need learn and practice. In Toastmasters there are many ways to help you improve
your communication skills. Determining your own communication style and make the best use of it
is one of them.

Communication style is how you interact with others and how you deliver messages. There are
basically four kinds of communication style:
 - direct
 - initiating
 - supportive
 - analytical

Toastmasters' website provides a real situation evaluation tool, which can help you determine
your own communicat style. It shows you a commnication situation, and ask you how to handle.
I think it is very scientific and can give you a good judgement.

I have done my assessment. Most of my points are from supportive communication style, and a little
is from direct style. So I know that I am a supportive communicator.

Supportive communicators appreciate a calm, steady approach. Because people with supportive
communication style dislikes change, they may appear indecisive. More often they are perceived as
careful, patient, and amiable. Due to their active listening skills, others see them as cooperative,
dependable, and loyal. They are often modest and prefers praise be given privately. Patient and
slow-paced, they like a personal, relaxed, no-tension environment. They put high priority on
close relationships and do not like conflict, butmay mediate if necessary.

I am also a little direct communicators, so sometimes I prefer when you get to the point quickly
and in a succinct manner. While people with direct communication style is results-oriented, focused,
and competitive, they are motivated to get things accomplished, they are quick and decisive. Because
they are independent and confident, they prefer a busy, efficient and structured environment. Others
may sometimes perceive them as impatient and demanding. So allowing others to share feelings and
explain details can encourage dialogue for direct communicators.

Each communication style has value and there is no best overall style. You may be comfortable using
one style in many situations, but is not necessarily what you choose in all communication. Communication
styles are often situational. Be sure to monitor your application of communication styles. Decide
if your current style is effective based on feedback and outcomes. If necessary, adjust your behavior
and adopt new styles to fit a situation, team, or person.

I hope all of you now understand my communication style, and make the best use of tips to communicate
with me. I will also pay attention to my ways of communication in different situation, so that we can
exchange ideas and feelings much better.

Thank you.
