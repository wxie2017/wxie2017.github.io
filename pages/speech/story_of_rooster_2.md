I was younger. Trust me, dear audience, contest chair. I was much younger.

When I was a little kid, my family lived in a large flat building together
with 6 other families. We shared a huge front yard.

I still remember that a warm spring morning, a street vendor walked into
the sunny yard and began to sell chickens. we kids ran around him and dared
to touch those little things, and they even pecked our fingers.

"Mama, could you buy some chickens?"
"Go to ask your dad."
"Dad, could you buy some chickens?"
"Go to ask your mom. She has all the money."
"Mama..."

I wish I had learned Table Topics skills at that time.

Finally, several families bought a few chickens. My parents bought a dozen.
We brothers promised to raise them carefully.

We fed our chickens every day and they grew fast. Sadly, some died
along the way. We have 7 left: 3 roosters and 4 hens. The neighbors had the
similar. All the roosters and hens lived in the open yard.

Our 3 roosters sometimes fought each other, and one of them became the winner.
His name was little flower（小花）.

Little flower was a very beautiful rooster. He had bright red comb，golden yellow
neck, yellow and black body and a splendid colorful tail. His eyes were sharp and
bright, and he crowed loudly and proudly.

We killed the other 2 roosters, and made delicious meals. I insisted on keeping
little flower because I liked him so much.

Little flower had his kingdom and he ruled with love. When he scratched up something
good in the yard, he divided with the hens. He cared the family. However, life wasn't
easy in the open yard. It was a violent time, all the roosters had to fight to conquer
more territory for their families.

Little flower often won the fight and then he stood on his toes, clapped his wings,
puffed out his golden chest and sang out. What a proud, fine looking bird he was!
I was so happy.

Time elapsed quickly.

Next year, the street vendor came again. Now he sold better chickens. They grew faster
and stronger. Our neighbors bought some.

The yard became crowed with new roosters and hens.

One day, I came home from school. I did not see the usual welcome from little flower.
He was not in the yard. Where was he？

I checked the hen-house. There he was! Little flower sat deeply inside the hen-house.
I called him out. Oh ho! What had happened? Little flower's face was full of blood
and he lost one of his eyes.

It was not hard to imagine.

There must have been a horrifying fight between little flower and the neighbor's new
rooster. Apparently, he lost the fight and lost his eye. I was very sorrow and hold him
tightly, almost cried.

That weekend, my family had a chicken meal. I didn't eat.

This ends the story of little follower. However, I cannot get away with him from my
mind. I sometimes asked myself why I still remember a rooster after so many years,
and I could not get an answer that satisfied myself. Whether it was heart breaking
or tear bursting,Little flower's golden feature and bleeding face were deeply
printed in my young mind vividly just like yesterday.

Today, I am glad that I could give a speech about little follower in a Toastmasters
meeting. It is a great relief for me because I finally got the chance to show my respect
to a wonderful little creature who had lived his life with love and honor, glory and
failure, which gives me much fun whether young or old.

Dear audience, have you ever had the same feeling? Have you ever had a dear friend to
commemorate? Have you ever had a vivid story to tell?

Toastmasters meeting is the very stage to tell your story. All you need is to act. Come
to this stage and tell your story like my little flower.

Farewell, little flower. Farewell, the great rooster.

Thank you.
