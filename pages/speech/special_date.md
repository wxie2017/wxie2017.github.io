Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am glad to host the table topics session.

Table Topics session is one of the most exciting sessions of a Toastmasters' meeting.
Each and every one of you is encouraged to come to the stage and give an impromptu
speech, including our distinguished guests. Because we have limited time, so I do
hope you grasp the opportunity to speak as early as possible.

When you are on the stage, I, as the Table Topics master, ask you a question, and
your speech should be around your answer to my question.

If you can talk more than 1 minute from your first verbal or non-verbal communication
to the audience, your speech is a qualified Table Topics speech. If you speech are
longer than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, your speech is disqualified as well. Please pay
attention to our timer's sign.

1 minute for blue card
1 minute 30 seconds for yellow card
2 minute for red card
and bell to stop talking

Any questions?

As the TMD said, today's topic is the special date. Today is a special date
for me. However, I should not talk that date too much.
And let's begin our journey.

Who wants to be the first?

Q1. What comes to your mind when you hear "the special date"?

Q2. What does a typical day look like for you?

Q3. Anything surprising or special happened today for you?

Q4. How to kill your time in your favorite public holiday?

Q5. What's your special way to remember your private special date?

Q6. What is the most interesting foreign public holiday for you?

Q7. Give your a chance to create a new public holiday,
    which date would you recommend?

Q8. Which day is the most unforgettable date in your life?
Take a moment to recall that unforgettable day, and tell more
people about it.

Q9. What would you do if today is your last day?
The truth is, no one knows when they’ll die. This means that today
could very well be your last day on earth. Why waste it doing useless things?

Q10. If allowed, which date would you choose to be your birthday or goodbye day?

Thank you all for the inspiring speech about your special date. Remember that each
and every day is a special date in our life. Don’t put living your life to some day
in the future when the future is not assured. Instead, live your wildest life today,
because today is the only moment that you are assured of.

Thank you. Back to TMD.
