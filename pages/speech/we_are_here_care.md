Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Toastmasters International is an educational organization. Some of you
come to improve your English. Some of you come to get tips for public
speaking. Some of you come to become leaders.

What's your purpose in Toastmasters, Grace?
...

Toastmasters International has an educational system, called Pathways.
I know all of you started your Pathways, right?

What's your Pathways level, Wing?
Congratulations, Wing. You have finished Level 2. Great job.

I want to share with you a secret, Wing. When you finish level 2. You will
get a mini pathway - the mentor program. You can open your curriculum and
you will see it.

I have been a mentor for a while. Now I have 9 proteges. Some of them
just join our club. Some of them are already mentors themselves. Mentoring
another individual is a rewarding and challenging experience.

Grace is one of my proteges.

I still remember on November 14th last year. Grace and I sat down at the
table here in the club.

"Congratulations, Grace. You have done your Ice Breaker."
"Thank you, mentor, for the evalution."
"You can take my evaluation and prepare for your next speech."
"Alright, mentor."

We set the goal and plan that Grace could finish her level 2 in February.

Since then I care this goal seriously.

Dear fellow members, you know there are various kinds of people.
Some move fast, some move slowly. Guess what kind Grace is. She was fast
at the beginning, really fast. She finished level 1 before the new year
- in 2 months. I was very glad, and also learned much from her.

Afterwards, you know what happened? Holidays, right? Spring Festival, no
meeting, OK. We communicated during this long break about what she could
do. For example, she could practice her speeches and be ready to deliver.
But there was little progress in her pathways for months.

I was worried. However, I could not push too much. The lessons I learned
here is that I should listen more to her ideas and encourage her to make
the independent thinking. I can advice that she could write some of her
own stories as a speech, and she can also decide to write about something
that she feels more comfortable.

As long as we care about our goal, we are fine. Yes, fellow members, care
is the key word here. When we are here, and we care, we will keep the
communication going regardless of the pandemic, regardless of the on-line
meetings. When we are here and we care, we will see our goal and move
forward.

On 22nd of May, Grace delivered her last speech of level 2. She finished
level 2. Even though we are 3 months behind the original plan, we are
finally here and we still care.

Dear fellow toastmasters, do you still remember the four values of
Toastmasters? Integrity, Respect, Service and Excellence. Here we have
a fifth value from the mentor program - what is it? Care! Yes, care.

To care means when we tell people Toastmasters is good, and people join,
we should take care of them. Everybody is part of the mentor program.
We are all here and we should all care.

Thank you.
