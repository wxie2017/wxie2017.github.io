Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

The title of my speech today is free software is even more important today.

I have already introduced free software and why software should be free. We have
also talked about why schools should only use free software. Let's review a little
bit.

Free software is the software you can run, copy, distribute, study, change and
improve. Free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

All computer users deserve free software. We deserve to be able to study the
software we use and improve it. Free software gives us the freedom to control our
own computers, and gives us the freedom to cooperate with each other, and to live
an upright life.

The world has changed drastically in the past few months due to the ongoing crisis
of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Education, in particular, has been impacted: college
students have been sent home, day cares have been closed (leaving parents to juggle
their work responsibilities with childcare), and public schools have closed their
campuses and continued their educational services online.

The shift has been abrupt, so policy makers have not had much time to review the potential
risks (or benefits) of software options. Many administrators and teachers are basing their
tech decisions solely on pervasive marketing campaigns, bringing about Zoom's surge in
popularity. More importantly, decision makers have failed to see the long-term implications
of such a decision on students' freedom and privacy.

We must reverse the trend of forsaking young people's freedom, which has been accelerating
as corporations try to capitalize on the need to establish new remote education practices.
Free software not only protects the freedoms of your child or grandchild by allowing people
to study the source code for any malicious functionalities, it also communicates important
values like autonomy, sharing, social responsibility, and collaboration.

If you have a relationship with a school —if you are a student, a teacher, an employee,
an administrator, a donor, or a parent— it's your responsibility to campaign for the
school to migrate to free software. If a private request doesn't achieve the goal,
raise the issue publicly in those communities; that is the way to make more people
aware of the issue and find allies for the campaign.

When a program respects users' freedom and community, we call it “free software.”
We also sometimes call it “libre software” to emphasize that we're talking about
liberty, not price. Some proprietary (nonfree) programs, such as Photoshop, are very
expensive; others, such as Wechat, are available gratis—but that's a minor detail.
Either way, they give the program's developer power over the users, power that no one
should have.

Those two nonfree programs have something else in common: they are both malware. That is,
both have functionalities designed to mistreat the user. Proprietary software nowadays
is often malware because the developers' power corrupts them. That directory lists around
450 different malicious functionalities (as of January, 2020), but it is surely just the
tip of the iceberg.

With free software, the users control the program, both individually and collectively. So
they control what their computers do (assuming those computers are loyal and do what the
users' programs tell them to do).

With proprietary software, the program controls the users, and some other entity (the
developer or “owner”) controls the program. So the proprietary program gives its developer
power over its users. That is unjust in itself; moreover, it tempts the developer to mistreat
the users in other ways.

Even when proprietary software isn't downright malicious, its developers have an incentive to
make it addictive, controlling and manipulative. You can say, as does the author of that article,
that the developers have an ethical obligation not to do that, but generally they follow their
interests. If you want this not to happen, make sure the program is controlled by its users.

Freedom means having control over your own life. If you use a program to carry out activities in
your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program. You deserve to have control
over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life.

Other kinds of works are also used for practical activities, including recipes for cooking, educational
works such as textbooks, reference works such as dictionaries and encyclopedias, fonts for displaying
paragraphs of text, circuit diagrams for hardware for people to build, and patterns for making useful
(not merely decorative) objects with a 3D printer. Since these are not software, the free software
movement strictly speaking doesn't cover them; but the same reasoning applies and leads to the same
conclusion: these works should carry the four freedoms.

A free program allows you to tinker with it to make it do what you want (or cease to do something you
dislike). Tinkering with software may sound ridiculous if you are accustomed to proprietary software as
a sealed box, but in the Free World it's a common thing to do, and a good way to learn programming.
Even the traditional American pastime of tinkering with cars is obstructed because cars now contain
nonfree software.

If the users don't control the program, the program controls the users. With proprietary software,
there is always some entity, the developer or “owner” of the program, that controls the program
—and through it, exercises power over its users. A nonfree program is a yoke, an instrument of
unjust power.

In outrageous cases (though this outrage has become quite usual) proprietary programs are designed
to spy on the users, restrict them, censor them, and abuse them. For instance, the operating system
of Apple iThings does all of these, and so does Windows on mobile devices with ARM chips. Windows,
mobile phone firmware, and Google Chrome for Windows include a universal back door that allows some
company to change the program remotely without asking permission. The Amazon Kindle has a back door
that can erase books.

Nonfree software was the first way for companies to take control of people's computing. Nowadays,
there is another way, called Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS. That means letting someone
else's server do your own computing tasks.

SaaSS doesn't mean the programs on the server are nonfree (though they often are). Rather, using
SaaSS causes the same injustices as using a nonfree program: they are two paths to the same bad
place. Take the example of a SaaSS translation service: The user sends text to the server, and
the server translates it (from English to Spanish, say) and sends the translation back to the
user. Now the job of translating is under the control of the server operator rather than the user.

When you use proprietary programs or SaaSS, first of all you do wrong to yourself, because it
gives some entity unjust power over you. For your own sake, you should escape. It also wrongs
others if you make a promise not to share. It is evil to keep such a promise, and a lesser evil
to break it; to be truly upright, you should not make the promise at all.

There are cases where using nonfree software puts pressure directly on others to do likewise.
Skype is a clear example: when one person uses the nonfree Skype client software, it requires
another person to use that software too—thus both surrender their freedom. (Google Hangouts
have the same problem.) It is wrong even to suggest using such programs. We should refuse to
use them even briefly, even on someone else's computer.

All the forms of indirect harm are magnified when the user is a public entity or a school.

Public agencies exist for the people, not for themselves. When they do computing, they do
it for the people. They have a duty to maintain full control over that computing so that they
can assure it is done properly for the people. (This constitutes the computational sovereignty
of the state.) They must never allow control over the state's computing to fall into private hands.

To maintain control of the people's computing, public agencies must not do it with proprietary
software (software under the control of an entity other than the state). And they must not entrust
it to a service programmed and run by an entity other than the state, since this would be SaaSS.

Proprietary software has no security at all in one crucial case — against its developer. And the
developer may help others attack. Microsoft shows Windows bugs to the NSA (the US government digital
spying agency) before fixing them. We do not know whether Apple does likewise, but it is under the
same government pressure as Microsoft. If the government of any other country uses such software, it
endangers national security. Do you want the NSA to break into your government's computers? See our
suggested policies for governments to promote free software.

Schools (and this includes all educational activities) influence the future of society through what
they teach. They should teach exclusively free software, so as to use their influence for the good.
To teach a proprietary program is to implant dependence, which goes against the mission of education.
By training in use of free software, schools will direct society's future towards freedom, and help
talented programmers master the craft.

I'm often asked to describe the “advantages” of free software. But the word “advantages” is too
weak when it comes to freedom. Life without freedom is oppression, and that applies to computing as
well as every other activity in our lives. We must refuse to give the developers of the programs or
computing services control over the computing we do. This is the right thing to do, for selfish
reasons; but not solely for selfish reasons.

Freedom includes the freedom to cooperate with others. Denying people that freedom means keeping them
divided, which is the start of a scheme to oppress them. In the free software community, we are very
much aware of the importance of the freedom to cooperate because our work consists of organized cooperation.
If your friend comes to visit and sees you use a program, she might ask for a copy. A program which
stops you from redistributing it, or says you're “not supposed to”, is antisocial.

In computing, cooperation includes redistributing exact copies of a program to other users. It also
includes distributing your changed versions to them. Free software encourages these forms of cooperation,
while proprietary software forbids them. It forbids redistribution of copies, and by denying users the
source code, it blocks them from making changes. SaaSS has the same effects: if your computing is done
over the web in someone else's server, by someone else's copy of a program, you can't see it or touch
the software that does your computing, so you can't redistribute it or change it.

We deserve to have control of our own computing; how can we win this control? By rejecting nonfree software
on the computers we own or regularly use, and rejecting SaaSS. By developing free software (for those of
us who are programmers.) By refusing to develop or promote nonfree software or SaaSS. By spreading these
ideas to others.

Join our cause, as a programmer or an activist. Let's make all computer users free.

Thank you.
