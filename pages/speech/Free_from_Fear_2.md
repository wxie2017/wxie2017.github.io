title: Free from Fear
description: This is a speech I prepare for my area contest 2023
---


You and I came to Toastmasters clubs like this paper - full of schedule.
We already have much experience in our life, but we still have one thing
in common - we still fear to speak on the stage.

Dear contest chair, ladies and gentlemen, have you ever felt
the fear when you stand on the stage facing so many eyes?

I had, and I still have.

When I joined Yu-Life Club in 2000, I was invited to the new member orientation
to give a speech. Raise your hands if you have attended such a meeting.

Yes. I thought I was sophisiticated and confident enough to do this.
Of course, I practiced a lot before the meeting.

On that day, the meeting started, I spoke. Audience applauded. The meeting ended.

Everything sounded wonderful, except that I had so much fear that I lost my words
for more than 10 seconds during my speech. I felt that all the effort was wasted.

As soon as the meeting finished, one person came to me and said,

"That's normal. Many of us have the same feeling."

That person is my Mentor.

Raise your hands if you have a mentor.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Toastmasters club has already prepared a system for you.
It is called mentoring. Mentors know your fear and will help you be free from fear.

Now I have been mentoring a few members in our club. I still remember last spring.
We had a new member. Because of the lock-down, members had never seen each
other besides on-line meetings. Because we have not had a new member for a
while, and I felt that I should call her and talk her.

"Hi, is this Lanlan?" My voice was a little trembling.
"Yes", a very soft female voice from the other side, making me free from fear.
"I am Laoxie. Welcome to join Yu-Life Club. How are you?" I said.
"Thanks, Laoxie. I am ok. Just stay at home." Lanlan said.
"How do you know our club?" The conversation continued.

That talk was not 5- to 7-minute, but over 30 minutes. We talked
about Toastmasters, Pathways, English, and career. The last thing we talked
was about choosing a mentor. I told her who were the qualified as mentors in our
club, I was on the list, and she said she would consider.

In a moment, I feared that she would choose me. In another moment, I feared
that she would not choose me. This was fear for unknown. Sounds familiar to
you, right?

Later, as you know, but surprised me, I became her mentor.

Mentor has one good thing. You communicate with your mentee and may know more
about her than other club members. I find that Lanlan is a natural public
speaker. I only need encourage her to follow the Pathways, and she would make
it.

She always find her own stories in the speeches. This is a great talent.
Her Icebreaker was about stories connected with the number of her member ID.
Her speech contest was about tension ans relaxition between herself and her
children. Each time she brings in vivid stories like what we all knew but ignored.

She is my mentor. I fear that I could not guide her enough on this.
However, the fear is useless. Lanlan set her own goals and followed her own
pace. She moves forward in her Pathways and Now she is a qualified mentor
in our club.

I learned many things during this mentorship. New members do not need mentor
to help them write speeches, they need mentor to help them know the fear of
public speaking is normal, they need mentor to encourage them to speak more.
Once you let them bravely show up on the stage, they will be free from fear,
they will do great job, they will be the one they want. As a mentor, I should
let them know their wish is much bigger than their fear. Just do it.

Lanlan she will go further, and will reach higher goals.

I as her mentor, should be free from fear because it is normal to have fear.

Dear ladies and gentlemen, the whole process is just like this paper, not the
paper full of schedule, but a white paper. When you have fear, you can hardly
write anything on it. When you are free from fear, you will draw your own
picture on it, you will shine your star on it, and you will be great on your
Pathways.

Raise your paper, and be free from fear.

Thank you.
