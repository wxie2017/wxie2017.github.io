title: Free from Fear
description: This is a speech I prepare for my area contest 2023
---


You and I came to Toastmasters clubs like this paper - full of schedule.
We already have much experience in our life, yet we still have one thing
in common - we still fear to speak on the stage.

Dear contest chair, ladies and gentlemen, have you ever felt
the fear when you stand on the stage facing so many eyes?

I had, and I still have.

When I joined Yu-Life Club in 2020, I was invited to the new member orientation
to give a speech.

Raise your hands if you ever attended such a meeting.

There would be many new faces in the meeting. At that time, I thought I was old,
sophisticated and confident enough to do the speech.

I practiced a lot and went on to the stage.

The meeting started, I spoke. I heard applauses. The meeting ended.

Everything sounded wonderful, except that I had so much fear on the stage that
I lost my words for more than 10 seconds during my speech.

Terrible moment!

As soon as the meeting finished, a beautiful lady came to me and said,

"That's normal. Many people have the same feeling."

These little words of wisdom made me feel better.

That lady is my Mentor.

Raise your hands if you have a mentor.

My mentor always encourages me to get on the stage, and this helps me to be
free from fear.

Now, I have been mentoring a few members in our club. I still remember last
spring. We had a new member. Because of the pandemic, members hadn't seen each
other in person for a while, and our club hadn't had a new member for a long
time. I thought that I should call the new member and talk her.

"Hi, is this Lanlan?" My voice was a little trembling.
"Yes", a very soft female voice from the other side, making me free from fear.
"I am Laoxie. Welcome to join Yu-Life Club. How are you?" I said.
"Thanks, Laoxie. I am OK. Just stay at home." Lanlan said.
"How do you know our club?" The conversation continued.

It was not a talk of 5- to 7-minute long. It was over 30 minutes. We talked
about Toastmasters. We talked about Yu-Life. We talked about career, and we
talked about family. At last we talked about mentoring. I gave her a list of
qualified mentors in our club including myself, she said she would consider.

In one moment, I feared that she would choose me. In another moment, I feared
that she would not choose me. The feeling sounds familiar to you, right?

Later, I became her mentor.

Being a mentor has one good thing. When Lanlan told me she was busy and had no
time to prepare a speech. I knew that she had fear so I insisted she get on to
the stage.

Each time Lanlan shows her great talent as a natural public speaker. Her
Icebreaker talks about stories connected with the number of her member ID.
Her speech contest talks about the tension and relaxation between herself
and her children. She always brings in vivid life stories in the speeches.
She has no fear.

As her mentor, I fear that I could not guide her enough. However, the fear
is useless. Lanlan set her own goals and followed her own pace. Now she is
a qualified mentor in our club.

Ladies and Gentlemen, you were all new members like Lanlan and me at some
time. Mentors will help you understand that it is normal to have fear on
the stage, and encourage you to speak more.

Once you bravely show up on the stage, you will be free from fear; you will
do a great job; you will be the one you want to be. I know your wish is much
bigger than the fear. Just do it.

The whole process is just like this paper, not the paper full of schedule,
but a white paper. When you have fear, you can hardly write anything on it.
When you are free from fear, you will draw your own picture on it, you will
shine your star on it, and you will be great on your Pathways.

Raise your paper, and be free from fear.

Thank you.
