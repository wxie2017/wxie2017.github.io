description: On 2022-02 I used this as club contest speech in Yulife club of Toastmaster.

I was younger, trust me. I was as young as you, dear contest chair,
fellow toastmasters and guests,

Once upon a time, I played a game called we're wolf with some friends.
In the game, either the wolves kill all the people, or the people
kill all the wolves, but we don't with guns, we use word.

In one game, there left three players including myself. I was sure who
was the only wolf. I urged the other human to vote the wolf out so we
could win this game. However, he seemed have doubt in me and trusted
the wolf's words. They voted me out! The wolf won again.

How angry I was! How upset I was! Why he just didn't listen to me!

Dear audience, have you ever had the same feeling?

When you regard some information as important, will you expect that
anyone exposed to that information fully absorb it?

I did in the game and failed, and then I was angry to the other player.
You know what? I was voted out in the next round immediately!

How sad I was!

This shows the reality: while learning how to communicate well is hard,
actually getting anyone to listen is much harder.

Since mobile phones and social media all this has got many times harder
because attention spans are shorter. I find that there is higher
expectation that communication should start from being nice.

To be nice is to respect. I didn't realize this until I have a kid. Talking
to little kids can be frustrating sometimes - they just wouldn't listen. When
we stood straightly and talk to our son, he would not follow; if we lowered
our body and kept the same height as our kid, no matter what we want to
communicate, he started to listen and response. There is no need to raise our
voice and yell around. Being nice and respecting makes my life easier.

Even if we are on the weak side, being nice can also win us respect. Living
in a metropolis like Shanghai, we all cross the streets many times a day.
What would you do before you cross the street? (very good) When I am crossing
the stree and a car stopped and waited, I will give the driver a thumb-up
to show my respect to her nice behavior. I think both of us will feel happy
for the day. Don't you agree? Being nice makes my life happier.

To be nice is to be positive. We all want a relaxed, no-tension environment.
But sometime there is a conflict and there can be opinions I disagree. To
be nice is particularly necessary in these situations. For example, in a
Toastmasters meetings, an evaluator may use some strong words on my speech,
I may feel insulted. But I should still give my apprieciation. Anyway, the
evaluator is another human being, just like myself. She just intended to help
me regardless which word she uses in her evaluation. We all need forgive and
improve. If we can share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing
conversation, we are fine. Being nice and positive helps build a friendly
community.

The game continued, and I as a dead player, observed the different behaviors
from the other players. Finally, I see something there: I can always start
our communication from

Being nice!

even if I am a wolf.
