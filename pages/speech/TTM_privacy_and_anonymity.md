Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will host the table topic session.

This is a session that we encourage everyone to come to the stage to enjoy speaking
to the public.

There are 8 rules here, a lot but very simple.

1. When you come to the stage, we shake hands first with smiles, of course.

2. Then I will ask you to draw a question from the plate about today's TableTopics.

3. You speak out the question, think about it for 10 seconds, then deliver
a speech as the answer.

4. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

5. One of the audience could challenge you with a question.

6. You can answer that question, too.

7. Please write down your name on the white board after your speech.

8. We shake hands and you can go back to sit.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

As you have read in our agenda, the TableTopics is privacy and anonymity.
Could anyone explain this word?

Privacy is usually meant in the context of sensitive personal data like for
instance place of living or religion, but I think in the broader sense it
is about anything you only want to share with a select audience.

Anonymity is about finding out who you are, identifying you (or not being able to).
Anonymity is another concept of privacy. It’s kind of middle ground where observation
is permitted—that is, where we expose our actions in public, but where our identities
and intentions are not ordinarily subject to close scrutiny.

Now who wants to be the first to come to the stage?


Q1. Some people think that they have nothing to hide, so there is no need for
them to protect privacy or stay anonymity. What's your opinion on this?


Q2. Image that you live in a room with one direction glass walls, which people
can observe your from outside but you do not know. What will you behave?


Q3. If you become invisible for an hour every day, and people don't know that
you are invisible, how will your life change?


Q4. If you know that all your phone calls are recorded and heard by someone else,
What will you do?


Q5. Many people want to be famous. While celebrities normally have less privacy,
because their personal data will be dug out and made public. Would you want
to be famous?


Q6. Once you lost your ID in a foreign city, how would you prove you are you?


Dear audience, in everyday life we leave behind an electronic data trail that is
suffused with information such as: bank account transactions, phone records, airplane
reservations, smart card travel logs, to name just a few. Likewise, in the physical
realm of biometrics and drones, it often involves the collection of publicly exposed
information in which we also have an anonymity-based privacy interest.

Make privacy your priority when using apps or services that have
access to your personal information such as full name, email address, phone
number, location, etc.

Online anonymity is a case-by-case need. Generally, you’d want
to be anonymous anytime you’re doing something you wouldn't want
to be traced back to you or your online personas.


Protect your data is protect your future.

Thank you.
