Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Last time I talked about copyright and copyleft, but it seems many of you still have
problem in understanding the concept.

Thanks to VPE for letting me use the table topic time to discuss this idea again. I
would like to do the table topic differently from a normal one.

I will still ask questions, and you come to the stage to present your ideas. This is
the normal part. After one of my question, you can also ask a question and any one
can come to the stage to answer. If no one comes, I will try to answer the question.

Here comes my first question: What is your understanding of copyright?
Please come here to answer.

Now who will ask the second question? Please.

Very good question, (repeat the question, and confirm with the question provider.)
who will give the answer?

Copyleft is a method developed by Richard Stallman. An author can place her
copyright into the work, and use distribution terms, which gives everyone the rights
to use, modify, and redistribute the code, but only if those distribution terms remain
unchanged. My second question, what is the main difference between copyleft and
copyright?

Now it is time for you to ask the fourth question. Please.
Very good question, (repeat the question, and confirm with the question provider.)
who will give the answer?

As an example, let us think about menu or recipe. If you cook a meal, and your friends
want to know the recipe. What would you do?

Now you can ask the last question?

In the time of information technology, copyright becomes restriction on the public.
So the copyleft was innovated to provide public benefit in sharing information and
controling our computation.

Thank you.
