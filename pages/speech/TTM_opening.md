Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am glad to host the table topics session. However, I am not the Table Topics Master.

Actually, I don't want to alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention that the
person to your right is a master. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a master. In fact
the person sitting in very seats is a Master. You just need come to the stage.

There are 8 rules here, a lot but very simple.

    When you come to the stage, we shake hands first with smiles, of course.

    Then I will ask you a question about today's Table Topics.

    You speak out the question, think about it for 10 seconds, then deliver a speech as the answer.

    Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please respect our timer's signal.

    One of the audience could challenge you with a question.

    You can answer that question, too.

    Please write down your name on the white board after your speech.

    We shake hands and you can go back to sit.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

As you have read in our agenda, today's topic is astonishing opening of speeches.

Here comes the first master.

Q1: How would you introduce yourself to us in a surprising way?

Q2: What would you say about your home town to gain our interest?

Q3: When is the happiest moment in your life so far?

Q4: Why can't you express you anger towards your friends?

Q5: Where are you sitting in the meeting room?

Q6: Who is your best friend?

Q7: Why do you like or hate dogs?

Q8: When is your first time heard about Toastmasters?

Q9: How would you eat an apple?

Q10: What would you say to the report about your opinion on the covid-19?

I really hear many great openings from you. Thank you.

Great opening lines to a speech get us curious and can set the direction
for a powerful talk.

In those first few seconds you have the chance to gain your audienceâ€™s
attention, earn their trust, and persuade them you are someone worth listening to.

Practice. You will be the masters.

Thank you. Back to TMD.
