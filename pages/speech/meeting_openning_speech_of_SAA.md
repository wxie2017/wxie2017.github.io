Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Welcome to Yu-life Toastmaster club. My name is Xie Wensheng. I am the Sergeant
At Arms in Yu-life club.

Toastmasters International is a non-profit educational organization which teaches
public speaking and leadership skills through a world wide network of clubs.

Yu-life club holds regular meetings every Sunday except public holidays. In our
meetings, we show our integrity, respect, service and excellence to our members
and guests. We provide a supportive and positive learning experience to empower
our members to develop communication and leadership skills, resulting in greater
self-confidence and personal growth.

Before we proceed, as the SAA, I remind you to turn off your mobile phones or
set them on silent mode. Thank you.

Please welcome our club president Amanda to the stage.
