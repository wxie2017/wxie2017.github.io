Dear Fellow members, honored chair:

This is a surprisingly good gift.

I would like to take this chance to thank all the people who have been with
me along the way. Special thanks to my wife, for her patience in allowing me
to spend time in Toastmasters club.

last but not least, Yu-life club members, I miss you on the stage.

Back to the hosts.
