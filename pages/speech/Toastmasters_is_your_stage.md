Fellow Toastmasters,
Dear new members,

Congratulations to you for taking the first steps to your personal and professional growth.

My name is Xie Wensheng. I am from YuLife Toastmasters club.

Many of you join Toastmasters International because you want to practice your English. So I
decided to do my sharing with you in English.

A quick question to you, fellow members, could you please guess how many years I have been a
member of Toastmasters International?

(ask a lady and a gentleman. Appreciate their answers. They possible guess the wrong number.)

Thank you for the answers. They encourage me a lot. In fact, I am a 100-day member, and just
renewed my membership last month. Today, I am very honored to be standing here to show you
that whether you are a new member or you are an old member, Toastmasters is your stage. All
you need is to act.

Everyone comes here for a reason. My reason to join Toastmasters International is to learn
public speaking. This is not a dream from my childhood. The dream when I was a child
was to become a scientist as I was doing well in schools, and good students should choose
scientists as their goals at that time.

I went to university, studied physics; I went to insitute, did research in
physics; and I was a young scientist. Dreams change often. Then the internet
came, and I followed the trend to become a software engineer. In the meantime, I encountered
many great ideas during my life journey. Some of them are so inspiring and so important and
I cannot help sharing them to more people. Then I got to know Toastmasters
from one friend's wechat Moment. The dream to become a public speaker awakes from my heart.
I visited several clubs, Chinese clubs, English clubs, Chinese-English clubs, English-Chinese clubs.
I joined Yu-life club, and I know I can learn from the club because we have many
great people here, and I know I can improve my public speaking skills because we
have great meetings every time.

I know toastmasters is the stage. All I need is to act. The same applies to you, my fellow members.
Here are my tips to make the most of your Toastmasters learning experience.

First, log in to www.toastmasters.org/login to ensure that your username and password are correct.
How many of you have logged in to the web using your member ID?
(wait for some answers)
It is important to remember your ID.

After your login, please make sure you select your Pathways. Pathways is the foundation of the
Toastmasters' education program. This is critical to your growth. It compliments your club experience
by giving you access to engaging learning tools, including videos, interactive quizzes and activities,
feedback and recognition, useful tips and more.

Then you come to the second interesting part. Possibly your vice president education will pair you
with a mentor, to help you along the way. You can also pick someone who stands out to you in some way
as your mentor. Perhaps you were really engaged by one of their speeches. Maybe you noticed that they
are highly active in supporting the club. Or, they might already possess the kinds of skills you hope
to improve upon.

Now it is your show time. You prepare your first project, the Ice Breaker. Work closely with your mentor
to prepare for this first speech. Your mentor has been there before and has excellent ideas for what
to speak about and how to do it. It is important to get over any fear or nervousness regarding
your first speech, just do it as I am doing it right now. Tell your story, share your dream, enjoy the stage.
Once you complete your first speech, you will truly feel that you are building strong relationships
and becoming confident on the stage.

Besides speeches, there are many other things that make you like the stage.

I encourage you to choose a role in every meeting you attend. There are enough roles:
(ask the audience about role) Which roles do you know of?

TMD (Toastmaster of the day), timer, Ah-counter, grammarian, TTM (table topic master),
GE (general evaluator), TTE (table topic evaluator), IE (individual evaluator). Each role
gives you some unique experience on the stage. I have been Ah-counter, grammarian, TTE and
IE and have also been evaluated by them. It's good to earn the appreciation of honest
critics from your fellow members.

You can also choose to become a club officer. I am the SAA (sergeant at arms) in my club.
Serving my club has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for every single day.
This is the stage that not only improves my communication skills but also develops my
leadership skills. If there is a chance, please be a club officer.

Most of all, welcome to your Toastmasters journey. There is much to learn and explore as
a member of Toastmasters International. You are encouraged to ask any of our members for
help. We are here to support you.

Remember, Toastmaster is your stage. All you need is to act.

Thank you.
