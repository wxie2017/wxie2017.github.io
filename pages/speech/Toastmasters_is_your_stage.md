Fellow Toastmasters,
Dear new members,

Congratulations for taking the first step on your journey to personal and professional growth.
how to make the most of your Toastmasters learning experience.

The foundation of the Toastmasters experience is the education program, called “Pathways,” which is critical to your growth. It compliments your club experience by giving you access to engaging learning tools, including videos, interactive quizzes and activities, feedback and recognition, useful tips and more. Pathways, available online or in print, lets you choose where and how you want to learn.


    Opportunity to develop many skills relevant to an evolving global marketplace
    Frequent recognition of educational achievements
    Online access to educational materials
    Engaging videos that model the skills you are learning

Tips to get Started:

    Log in to www.toastmasters.org/login to ensure that your username and password are correct.
    Enroll in Pathways—the Toastmasters education program.
    Review The Navigator—your guide to Toastmasters.*
    Sample your first project, the Ice Breaker.
    Ask your vice president education to pair you with a mentor, to help you along the way.


It is a pleasure to welcome you as the newest members of YuLife Club. We take
pride in providing a safe, respectful, and encouraging environment for you
to develop your communication and leadership skills. We all want you to
succeed in achieving your goals.

Pick someone who stands out to you in some way as your mentor. Perhaps you
were really engaged by one of their speeches. Maybe you noticed that they
are highly active in supporting our club. Or, they might already possess the
kinds of skills you hope to improve upon.

Work closely with your mentor to prepare for your first speech. Your mentor
has been there before and has excellent ideas for what to speak about and
how to do it. It is important to get over any fear or nervousness regarding
your first speech. Once you complete your first speech, you will truly feel
that you are building strong relationships and becoming a valuable member of
our club.

Crafting welcome messages for new employees is a tedious task.

They say, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression”. The quote holds true when we are talking about onboarding new employees to the company. Making every employee feel comfortable and familiar with their new working environment is the best way to start a healthy work relationship. And this crucial step can help you pave the path for boosting employee engagement and building a productive workforce.

69% of employees who undergo effective onboarding are more likely to stay with an employer for at least 3 years, and 58% are more likely to stay on for more than 3 years. (Source: O.C Tanner)

Here’s a list of 25 thoughtful welcome messages that your new employees would love to hear. Choose the best ones from the list to convey your wishes and give them a great onboarding experience.
