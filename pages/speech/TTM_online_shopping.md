Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will host the table topic session. This is a session that we encourage everyone
to come to the stage to enjoy speaking to the public.

There are 2 rules here.

1. When you come to the stage, please write down your name on the white board first.

2. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

In three days there will be a famous fest for online shopping - the double 11 shopping
festival. Our topic is about online shopping. Is there anybody who has never done online
shopping? Please raise your hand. No, I am relaxed. So all of us have shopped through
internet.

First question, an easy one. What did you buy most via online shopping?

People buy various kinds of goods from internet. Very interesting. Now the second question,
what was your best online shopping experience?

Even if there are shops nearby, we often still choose to shop online. The third question,
what do you think are the advantages of online shopping?

For sure there are a lot of advantages of online shopping. However, some people are worried
about online shopping. The fourth question, what is your biggest concern of online shopping?

Yes, privacy and quality can be big problems for the consumers. The last question, what are
your methods in protecting your privacy when shopping online?

Ok, please keep in mind, the data are yours. Be carefully with your data, and protect them
whenever you can.

If we have time, I will raise a last question for all of you. Which kind of online shop do
you want to open?

Hope you all have good experience in the coming double 11.

Thank you.
