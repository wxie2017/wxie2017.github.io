Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Toastmasters members have a long history of supporting and nurturing each other through mentorship. A mentor offers encouragement and guidance to a fellow member of Toastmasters while he or she works to accomplish goals. A mentor has the opportunity to share experience, wisdom, and knowledge while a protégé gains a foundation for building skills and meeting goals. Mentoring can be a rewarding experience for both the mentor and the protégé.

A mentor is an experienced member who provides guidance and support to empower protégés to reach their goals. The most successful mentors have been protégés and often continue to work with mentors of their own. Understanding the role of the protégé is fundamental to being the best mentor you can be.

To become a mentor, a member must be in good standing for at least six months, complete an entire path, and successfully complete mentorship training with positive evaluations from protégés. Each mentorship commitment lasts for a period of six months but may extend longer if both protégé and mentor agree.

Personal Experience: Mentors are experienced Toastmasters who understand the Toastmasters mission and values. They can offer a wide spectrum of skills and expertise that can benefit a protégé. Some mentors may more effectively support a new member as he completes his first projects, while other mentors are best suited to guide a longstanding member working toward a challenging leadership goal.

Wisdom: An experienced and knowledgeable mentor knows the value of her wisdom. She also knows how to balance sharing her expertise with allowing her protégés to learn on their own.

For example, a mentor can support a protégé by listening to the thoughts, concerns, and challenges he faces as he approaches a new project. She may choose to share her understanding by discussing her experience completing a challenging project and what she has gained as a result of the work.

Informed Perspective: A knowledgeable mentor is able to confidently and non-judgmentally address any questions from her protégé while knowing when to step aside and allow the protégé to learn independently. A mentor’s perspective from time in Toastmasters provides a framework for guiding any protégé.

Successful Strategies: Mentors support protégés by reinforcing successful strategies and providing constructive guidance when protégés face challenges as they work toward their goals.

While completing some projects, a protégé may simply need someone to listen to her thoughts and frustrations. At other times, she may benefit from hearing the ways her mentor overcame obstacles to create positive and successful outcomes.

Unconditional Support: When a mentor is helping his protégé plan for a challenging speech, he can encourage her by listening to her speech topic ideas and sharing what he likes about each topic. By providing non-judgmental support as his protégé makes a choice that she feels most passionate about, the mentor helps his protégé gain confidence in her ability to create a successful speech.

Focus on Similarities: A strong mentor focuses on similarities rather than differences. Showing respect for a protégé’s unique experiences and background builds a positive rapport that is a foundation for a well-balanced partnership.

Identify Needs: Asking questions and listening to identify a protégé’s specific needs and goals are two ways a mentor can demonstrate respect and caring. By listening and noting differences, but focusing on commonalities, he can enhance the partnership with his protégé.

Tailor Feedback: A tailored approach to suggestions and feedback, designed to coordinate with the protégé’s goals and personality, will form a strong foundation for success.

For example, a mentor and a protégé may both be highly experienced Toastmasters from very different professional backgrounds. A mentor can benefit his protégé by finding commonalities in their Toastmasters experience and sharing new information and knowledge from her professional background.

Preparedness: Commitment is an essential requirement of a successful mentor–protégé relationship. This commitment can range from being prepared and on time for meetings to ensuring consistent communication.

Presence: When circumstances dictate, a mentor may need to be available to provide additional opportunities for a protégé to practice an upcoming speech in-person. A mentor demonstrates commitment by being present when her protégé presents the speech to his or her club.

The mentor–protégé relationship is often mutually beneficial. Because of Toastmasters unique system of club membership, many members in need of a mentor are accomplished in other places in their lives.

Members with all levels of experience can benefit from having a mentor. No matter how much experience a member has, she can grow and learn from having personalized support as she works toward goals.

Through mentorship, protégés gain self-confidence and will often achieve at a higher rate than members without the encouragement and support of a mentor. One of the great, often hidden, benefits of working with a mentor is the opportunity to advance little-used talents. It is often through the encouragement of another that we share a talent others have never seen.

Mentors and coaches are often thought of as having similar roles. The two positions can overlap, but are actually very different. Coaching can be part of mentorship, but mentors are not coaches.

Coaches are responsible for protégés meeting a specific short-term goal. The type of goal that a coach can most effectively facilitate is skills-based and specific. For example, a coach can have a powerful impact when a member wants to enhance or develop his use of gestures when presenting a speech.

Though a member is ultimately responsible for the accomplishment of his goals, a coach will take control of the method for reaching a single goal in the short-term. A coach may require a member to accomplish several steps in the process of meeting his goal. The two members may need to schedule multiple meetings over a short period of time to practice or review, depending on the goal.

A mentor’s role is to support a protégé as he takes personal responsibility for working toward the accomplishment of broader goals over a sustained period of time.
