Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

A question to the members:

Do you know Pathways? (ok, most of you do.)

How many of you have done level-2? (good)

In Pathways level-2, we will determine how to improve our relationships
by mastering and adapting our communication styles and tailor our message
to match situational expectations.

This is an important project, and I feel it is hard: even if I know my
communication style is supportive, I still don't know how to explore it
properly.

Dear audience, how you ever felt that when you regard some information as
important, you will expect that anyone exposed to that information will
fully absorb it?

When you told your friends Toastmasters are good, Yu-Life club is nice.
And invited them to come, but they didn's show up. This shows the reality
- while learning how to communicate well is hard, actually getting anyone
to listen is many times harder.

And since mobile phones and social media all this has got many times harder;
attention spans are shorter and I find that there is a higher expectation
that communication should start from being nice.

To be nice is to respect. When we talk to our kids, we want to lower our body
and keep the same height as our kids no matter what we want to communicate.
This is being nice and respect the kids.

To be nice is to response. Nowadays we have some many ways to communicate,
phone calls, wechat, wechat groups, face to face talks, etc., when someone
send you a message, please reply it in time. She cares about you, you should
acknowledge and apprieciate that. Treat the message the same way as you treat
the red packet.

To be nice is to be positive. We all want a relaxed, no-tension environment.
But sometime there is conflict and there can be opinions you disagree. To
be nice is particularly necessary in these situation. For example, the
evaluator may use some strong words on your speech, you may feel insulted. But
anyway, the evaluator is another human being, one very much like yourself.
We all need forgive and improve. If we can share skills, knowledge and
interests through ongoing conversation, we are fine.

lastly, to be nice is to be humorous. Humor is the good remedy for a lot of
things. It helps you out of embrassment, out of conflicts. When you want to
make people feel comfortable, help them laugh. I also find it more effective if
the information to communicate to be encoded with humor. (find a joke)

All in all, whether your communication is supportive as mine, or direcct, or
initiating, or analytical, you can always start you communication from

Being nice!

Thank you.
