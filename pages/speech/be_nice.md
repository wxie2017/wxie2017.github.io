Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

A question to the members:

Do you know Pathways? (ok, most of you do.)

How many of you have done level-2? (good)

In Pathways level-2, we will determine how to improve our relationships
by mastering and adapting our communication styles and tailor our message
to match situational expectations.

This is an important project, and I feel it is hard: even if I know my
communication style is supportive, I still don't know how to explore it
properly.

Dear audience, how you ever felt that when you regard some information as
important, you will expect that anyone exposed to that information will
fully absorb it?

When you told your friends Toastmasters are good, Yu-Life club is nice.
And invited them to come, but they didn's show up. This shows the reality
- while learning how to communicate well is hard, actually getting anyone
to listen is many times harder.

And since mobile phones and social media all this has got many times harder;
attention spans are shorter and I find that there is a higher expectation
that communication should start from being nice.

To be nice is to respect. I didn't realize this until I have a kid. Talking
to little kids can be very hard sometimes - they just wouldn't listen. When we
talked to my son, if we stood straightly and talk to him, he would not follow
what we said; if we lowered our body and kept the same height as our kid, no
matter what we want to communicate, he started to listen and response. This
made the life much easier. There is no need to raise your voice and yell around.
It is because of being nice and respecting the kids.

Even if you are on the weak side, being nice can also win respect. In a metroplis
like Shanghai, we all cross the streets many times a day. What would you do
before you cross the street? (very good) When I am crossing the stree and a
car stopped and waited, I will give the driver a thumb-up to show my respect to
her nice behavior. I think both of us will feel happy for the day. Don't you
agree? Being nice makes my life happier.

To be nice is to be positive. We all want a relaxed, no-tension environment.
But sometime there is conflict and there can be opinions I disagree. To
be nice is particularly necessary in these situation. For example, in our
meetings, the evaluator may use some strong words on my speech, you may feel
insulted. But I should still give my apprieciation, anyway, the evaluator is
another human being, one very much like yourself. He just wants to help me
regardless which word he uses in his evaluation. We all need forgive and
improve. If we can share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing
conversation, we are fine. I guess this is one of the reasons I was elected
as the club president. This gives me more chances to be nice.

All in all, whether your communication style is supportive as mine, or direcct,
or initiating, or analytical, you can always start you communication from

Being nice!

Thank you.
