Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will host the table topic session. This is a session that we encourage everyone
to come to the stage to enjoy speaking to the public.

There are 2 rules here.

1. When you come to the stage, please write down your name on the white board first.

2. Your speech should be at least 1 minute long, but no longer than 2 minutes. Please
respect our timer's signal.

Are there any questions? OK, let's begin.

Do you find it difficult to say “no”? If so, you’re not alone. Many people including
myself, struggle to say no to friends or at work when they are given additional tasks
because we like to please and be seen as capable. But if you have too many demands
and no more capacity available you should say no.

The key is that try not to feel guilty because it means that someone else can dedicate
the right amount of time and attention to the task. Assertiveness can be used in a
variety of ways to confidently and reasonably say "no".

We should be saying no more than we say yes, although the opposite is usually true.
Let's practice some basic ways to say no.

Q1 The awkward pause: Take your time before turning down a request. Refer to one of
   your personal rules. Borrow big money.

Q2 The soft “no” (or the “no but”): Sometimes being polite means finding a different
   way to say no. Thank the other person for their offer. Decline a date. And Yes,
   saying no directly is quite tough (for you)… that also can be heartbreaking
   (for someone) as well.

Q3 Let me check my calendar: Explain that your schedule is full. Invite dinner.

Q4 Use e-mail bouncebacks:

Q5 What should I deprioritize: Say that you aren’t the right fit. Explain how a
   “Yes” would affect other people. Friends visit and your examination.

Q6 Say it with humor: What’s the opposite of YES?

Q7 “You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y.”: Coming up with another solution is
   often the nicest approach. Offer a partial “yes”. Doing ppt for your friends.

Q8 “I can’t do it, but X might be interested.”: In professional situations, don’t be
   afraid to ask for help. Connect the person to someone who could help.

Q9 You can change your mind and still feel good about it.

Q10 Show empathy for the other person’s situation. Plan wedding and help.

Q11 Acknowledge authority when necessary: “I know the final decision is yours.
    But I really feel that..."

Q12 Back up your “no” with your body language: When you say no, stand or sit
    upright instead of slouching. Avoid bowing your head, try to maintain eye
    contact, and try not to fidget. You want to come across as confident, not
    nervous or submissive.

In summary, saying “No” helps you maintain healthy boundaries in your relationships
and strike a balance between helping others and making time for yourself.

In a world of more requests than we can possibly fulfill, learning how to say no with
grace and style is a skill we all need.


Thank you.
