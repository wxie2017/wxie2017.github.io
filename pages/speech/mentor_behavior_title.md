Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Dear fellow toastmasters, do you still remember the four values of
Toastmasters? Integrity, Respect, Service and Excellence. Here we have
a fifth value from the mentor program - what is it? Care! Yes, care.

In May, 2022, our club had a new member, Lanlan Geng, a typical lady's
name. At that time, I was thinking of the club officer successor plan.
The club Treasurer was still not ready. I heard that Lanlan was a professional
accountant. I thought maybe she would like to practice her profession
in our club so I called her.

In June, she did her Ice Breaker in her Pathways Presentation Mastery.
The title is 58.

On July 2nd, 2022, I had a call with one of my proteges, Lanlan Geng. She
will prepare her second speech. However, I want to discuss about the club
finance status.

Her second speech title is Failure and success for learning driving. I
was her IE. I told her that she is an incredibly good story teller. She
can naturally tell her own stories in front of people. Many people
could not do that easily.

“The most basic of human needs is the need to understand and be
understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them,”
said Nichols, who founded the International Listening Association
in 1979. In the early years of Toastmasters, the motto was “For
Better Listening, Thinking, Speaking,” with listening being the
first skill in the list.

What does this show us? That mentors are everywhere. You just have to
look, and ask. And you can have more than one. Mentoring, though, is
not just a role to play. It is a partnership. It has two requirements
—a person who wants to learn, and a person who wants to help. Mentors
like to work with people who are willing to do what it takes to grow.
The first step, then, in finding a good mentor is to become the type of
person that someone wants to work with.

In Toastmasters, you will start out with one mentor who will help you
learn the basics: how to be a timer, how to write your first few speeches
and how to work in Pathways. The mentor is assigned to you. Your vice
president education may offer you a choice of mentors—talk with each
one. Do your personalities click? Do they seem interested in being truly
helpful?

As you attend more meetings, you will see how each member has unique
strengths. Make a note of this, and when you need help in a particular
area, seek out the member who has the strongest skills in that area. I
am strong in speech delivery and wordsmithing. Another member will be
strong in speech organization. Someone else may be strong in body
language. Decide which members have the skills that you need today and
put together a mentoring team for yourself.

How do you know where you need to improve? Listen to your evaluators.
Do you frequently hear the same comments or suggestions?

The question remains: What is the value of a mentor? In a nutshell, it
is targeted, accelerated learning. The Toastmasters program is great—it
offers customized learning. Take advantage of it. Sometimes you will
need help to move forward. And sometimes you will need someone to hold
you accountable. A mentor can help you in all of these ways.

One final thought—mentoring goes two ways. We all have something to
share. Be willing to help someone else learn, even if you are new. That
is, after all, part of being a Toastmaster.

What establishes trust? Authenticity, simplicity, and creativity. All
elements of a great story. I always try to set the stage with a story
before diving into the data. Humans remember stories—it was the first
way we learned, and I find an insightful story can persuade people
from any walk of life.

As Toastmasters, we study all aspects of public speaking: organization,
tone, gesture, vocabulary, purpose and so on. All are important, but
they are all subordinate to—and driven by—our aim to connect with our
audiences. For this reason, being clear about our audience is absolutely
essential to delivering an effective speech.

Thank you.
