Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Dear fellow toastmasters, do you still remember the four values of
Toastmasters? Integrity, Respect, Service and Excellence. Here we have
a fifth value from the mentor program - what is it? Care! Yes, care.

In May, 2022, our club had a new member, Lanlan Geng, a typical lady's
name. At that time, I was thinking of the club officer successor plan.
The club Treasurer was still not ready. I heard that Lanlan was a professional
accountant. I thought maybe she would like to practice her profession
in our club so I called her.

In June, she did her Ice Breaker in her Pathways Presentation Mastery.
The title is 58.

On July 2nd, 2022, I had a call with one of my proteges, Lanlan Geng. She
will prepare her second speech. However, I want to discuss about the club
finance status.

Her second speech title is Failure and success for learning driving. I
was her IE. I told her that she is an incredibly good story teller. She
can naturally tell her own stories in front of people. Many people
could not do that easily.

Thank you.
