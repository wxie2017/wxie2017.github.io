Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

The title is "right to read".

Is it about right or left. No.
Is it about right or wrong. No.

It is about the fact we are legally allowed to do something, more specifically, if we are
allowed to read, if we have the right to read.

Am I kidding?

Of course not, we all have the right to read. It is one of the foundations of a democratic
society. Reading allows us to meet people, to debate philosophies, and to experience events
far beyond the narrow confines of our own existence.

(ask the audience)
Dear fellow members and distinguished guests,
Have you ever borrowed a book from a library?
Have you ever bought a book from a bookstore?

Many of you have. I have, too.

Recently, I bought the paper book Hong Lou Meng for my son, and I enjoy reading it, too.
And I can lent the book to others, too, if they also like it. I can lent it to as many
people as I like and no one can forbid this because we all have the right to read.

However, if I had ever had an e-reader, and bought the e-version of Hong Lou Meng, most
likely, I would not be able to lend it to others - this is not allowed. If I had ever
figured out how to get a copy of my Hong Lou Meng from the e-reader and sent it to my
friends, my friends' e-reader would simply refuse to open the copy - it would not work:
because the software in the e-reader has malicious features called Digital Restrictions
Management (DRM, for short) to forbid the sharing. The e-books are on-purposely designed
like this so that only that particular software with that malicious functionality can
display them.

DRM is the computer-enforced restrictions on lending or reading books. It is a denial to
the individual's right to read.

We have to fight for protecting our right to read, and we need fight bravely because
the battle is going against us so far. The enemy is organized, and readers are not.

In the US, the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) gave explicit government
backing to DRM, by making the distribution of programs that can break DRM a crime.
The European Union imposed similar restrictions in a 2001 copyright directive, in a
form not quite as strong.

Today, when I open the the Amazon website to buy books, there are only e-books for
Amazon's e-reader - Kindle. However, Kindle is designed to spy on everything the
reader does: it reports which book is being read, and which page, and it reports
when the reader highlights text, and any notes the reader enters. It has DRM, which
is intended to block readers from sharing copies. It has a back door with which
Amazon can remotely erase any book. In 2009, it erased thousands of copies of 1984,
by George Orwell. Readers experienced that the pages magically disappeared just in
front of their eyes. Virtual book-burning, is that what“Kindle”means?

If these policies were limited to Amazon, we'd bypass them, but the other e-book
dealers' policies are roughly similar.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, it doesn't have to be this way. Reading
is fun, sharing is good. Reading and sharing ought to be legal, and preventing sharing
by making e-books a restriction on readers is unethical. We must demand our right to
read and share.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, the title is "right to read".

Is it about right or left. Yes, we have to choose the right direction to fight.
Is it about right or wrong. Yes, it is all right to share e-books.

Because we all have the right to read.

Thank you.
