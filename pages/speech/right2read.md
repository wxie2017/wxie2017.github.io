Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

The title is "right to read".

Is it about right or left. No.
Is it about right or wrong. No.

It is about the fact we are legally allowed to do someting, more specifically, if we are
allowed to read, if we have the right to read.

Am I kidding?

Of course, we all have the right to read.

(ask the audience)
Dear fellow members and distinguished guests,
Have you ever borrowed a book from a library?
Have you ever bought a book from a bookstore?

Recently, I bought the paper book Hong Lou Meng for my son, and I enjoy reading it, too.
And I can lent to others, too, if they also like it. I can lent it to as many people as
I like and no one can forbid this.

If I had ever had an e-reader, and bought the e-version of Hong Lou Meng, most likely, I
would not be able to lend it to others - this is not allowed. If I had ever figured out
how to get a copy of my Hong Lou Meng from the e-reader and sent it to my friends. My
friends' e-reader would simply refuse to open the copy - it would not work: because the
software in the e-reader has malicious features called Digital Restrictions Management
(DRM, for short) to forbid the sharing. The e-books are on purposely designed like this
so that only that paticular software with that malicious functionality can display them.

DRM is the computer-enforced restrictions on lending or reading books. It is a denial to
the individual's right to read, which is one of the foundations of a democratic society.
Reading allows us to meet people, to debate philosophies, and to experience events far
beyond the narrow confines of our own existence.

We have to fight for protecting our right to read, and we need fight bravely because
the battle is going against us so far. The enemy is organized, and readers are not.

In the US, the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) gave explicit government
backing to DRM, by making the distribution of programs that can break DRM a crime.
The European Union imposed similar restrictions in a 2001 copyright directive, in a
form not quite as strong.

In March, 2009, a group called The Author's Guild raised loud objections to the
text-to-speech feature in Amazon's new Kindle 2. They claimed that reading a book
out-loud is a violation of US copyright law. Amazon then allowed publishers to
deactivate the Kindle's text-to-speech capabilities using the device's built-in
DRM.

Today, when I open the the Amazon shop to buy books, there are only e-books for
Amazon's e-reader - Kindle. However, It is designed to spy on everything the user
does: it reports which book the user is reading, and which page, and it reports
when the user highlights text, and any notes the user enters. It has DRM, which
is intended to block users from sharing copies. It has a back door with which
Amazon can remotely erase any book. In 2009, it erased thousands of copies of 1984,
by George Orwell. Readers experienced that the book magically disappeared when they
were reading. Virtual book-burning; is that what“Kindle”means?

If these policies were limited to Amazon, we'd bypass them, but the other e-book
dealers' policies are roughly similar.

Dear fellow members and distinguished guests, it doesn't have to be this way. Sharing
is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy. So sharing ought to be legal,
and preventing sharing is no excuse to make e-books into handcuffs for readers. If
e-books mean that readers' freedom must either increase or decrease, we must demand
the increase.

The title is "right to read".

Is it about right or left. Yes, we have to choose the right direction.
Is it about right or wrong. Yes, it is all right to share e-books.

Thank you.
