Dear fellow members and distingushed guests,

When we look at the night sky filled with stars, we are looking at a scientific
marvel. Those stars are not just twinkling lights, but gigantic celestial bodies
millions of light-years away, each possibly hosting a myriad of planets. Yet,
when a poet looks at the same stars, he sees a canvas filled with metaphors of
hope, dreams, and the infinite. The stars, thus, become a spark where science
meets emotion, and logic dances with creativity.

The spark is where the strokes of a painter become a study of human psychology,
where a musician's composition transforms into an exploration of sound waves,
where a poet's metaphors become a reflection of sociological perspectives.
This spark is where the awe-inspiring beauty of a galaxy can inspire a
masterpiece, and the intricate patterns in nature can lead to scientific
breakthroughs.

This spark is not the privilege of a select few; it's the common wealth of all
mankind. It's the collective force of our curiosity, creativity, and desire for
understanding. It connects us all, irrespective of our race, religion, or
nationality. It's a testament to our shared humanity and our collective quest
for knowledge and expression.

The spark is within us all. It's in the way we perceive the world, in the way we
question, in the way we create. Every question we ask, every discovery we make,
every piece of art we create, contributes to this collective spark.

When I was in high school, our geology teach asked us to make a model of the Earth,
our planet. When it was the time to turn in our work, one classmate used an egg
full of drawings of oceans and continents, a good looking Earth. Another classmate handed
out a blue balloon with mountains and rivers, a moving Earth. It was my turn. I
reluctantly put out a mud ball. It was totally anything but an Earth - fuzzy skin.
People could not recognize anything on it. I was thinking that people would laugh.

"This looks like a real Earth that is made of earth. The ups and downs are rivers
and mountains. You combined art and science together. Good job." our teacher said.

I was over-whelmed - art and science combined! How inspiring!

When art and science intersect, the spark they create is nothing short of magical.
It is a spark that can inspire a scientist to approach a problem creatively or an
artist to incorporate scientific concepts in their work. It is a spark that can
spur an individual to step outside their comfort zone, to explore new boundaries,
and to keep moving forward.

This spark, ladies and gentlemen, is not just a personal experience; it is a
collective force. It is the common wealth of mankind. It is a testament to our
shared curiosity, creativity, and desire for progress. It is a reminder that,
as humans, we are all explorers at heart, constantly seeking to understand,
create, and innovate.

In conclusion, let us cherish this spark that art and science create. Let us embrace
it as a source of inspiration, a catalyst for innovation, and a beacon of progress.
Let us remember that this spark, born from the confluence of art and science, is not
just a privilege, but a responsibility. A responsibility to keep questioning, keep
creating, and keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Because it is in this
spark, in this common wealth of mankind, that we truly find the inspiration to move
forward and explore new horizons.

Thank you.
