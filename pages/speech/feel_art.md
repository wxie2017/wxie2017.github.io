Dear fellow members and distingushed

  Good evening. Today, I want to invite you on a journey, a voyage between the
  realms of art and science, two disciplines that might seem contrary, but in
  reality, form the common wealth of mankind. The essence of this journey lies
  in the heart of an intriguing concept - "Feel Art."

  When we think about art, it's often the emotions, the ability to feel, that
  come to mind first. It's the tear in the eye of the observer standing in front
  of a moving painting, it's the goosebumps we get from a powerful symphony,
  it's the heartache we feel reading a tragic novel. Art, in its purest form, is
  the epitome of human emotion and expression. It's a language that transcends
  borders, cultures, and time.

  Now, consider science. It might appear as the polar opposite - systematic,
  logical, fact-driven. However, if we dig deeper, we find that science, much
  like art, is a product of human curiosity, creativity, and the intrinsic
  desire to understand the world around us. Be it the cosmos, the human body, or
  the atom, science strives to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

  But what happens when these two seemingly divergent paths intersect? The
  result, ladies and gentlemen, is the phenomenon we call "Feel Art."

  "Feel Art" is the convergence of emotion and intellect, the amalgamation of
  creative expression and systematic exploration. It's the realization that art
  and science are not separate entities, but two sides of the same coin, both
  aiming to explain, explore, and express the human experience and the world
  around us.

  When we look at the night sky filled with stars, we are looking at a
  scientific marvel. Those stars are not just twinkling lights, but gigantic
  celestial bodies millions of light-years away, each possibly hosting a myriad
  of planets. Yet, when a poet looks at the same stars, he sees a canvas filled
  with metaphors of hope, dreams, and the infinite. The stars, thus, become a
  "Feel Art" - a concept where science meets emotion, and logic dances with
  creativity.

  "Feel Art" is about embracing the beauty of the universe in its entirety. It's
  about acknowledging that the same world which can be analyzed under a
  microscope or observed through a telescope can also be painted on a canvas or
  described in a sonnet. It's about understanding that the wonders of the
  universe are not just scientific phenomena, but also sources of inspiration,
  emotion, and artistic expression.

  Art and science, thus, are the common wealth of mankind. They are the twin
  pillars upon which our civilization stands and evolves. They are the mirrors
  reflecting our past, present, and future. They are the languages we use to
  communicate, comprehend, and celebrate the marvels of the universe.

  In conclusion, "Feel Art" is not just an idea, but a perspective, a way of
  life. It's about seeing the world with both our hearts and minds. It's about
  feeling the rhythm in the equations and seeing the poetry in the stars. It's
  about understanding that art and science, emotion and logic, creativity and
  systematic exploration, are all integral aspects of the human experience.

  Let us all embrace "Feel Art," for it is in this union of art and science that
  we truly appreciate the common wealth of mankind. By doing so, we do not just
  observe the world, but we feel it, we live it, and we become a part of the
  grand tapestry of the universe.

  Thank you.

  You don't need to say feel art, rather please consider the word - spark.

  Ladies and Gentlemen,

  Good evening. Today, I invite you all to reflect on a simple yet profound
  concept - the "spark." More specifically, the spark that exists at the
  intersection of art and science, two disciplines that, while seemingly
  disparate, together form the common wealth of mankind.

  Art, in its most elemental form, is the expression of our deepest emotions and
  experiences. It's a timeless language that transcends borders, encapsulating
  the human spirit in its rawest form. It stirs emotions, provokes thought, and
  fosters empathy.

  On the other hand, science is the embodiment of our quest for knowledge and
  understanding. It is logical, systematic, and objective. It explains the world
  around us, from the infinitesimal atom to the vast cosmos. Science fuels
  innovation, drives progress, and shapes the future.

  Now, imagine the magic that happens when these two spheres intersect. At this
  crossroads, a spark ignites. This spark is not merely a flicker but a powerful
  force that lights up the path to exploration, creativity, and understanding.

  The spark is where the strokes of a painter become a study of human
  psychology, where a musician's composition transforms into an exploration of
  sound waves, where a poet's metaphors become a reflection of sociological
  perspectives. This spark is where the awe-inspiring beauty of a galaxy can
  inspire a masterpiece, and the intricate patterns in nature can lead to
  scientific breakthroughs.

  Art and science, though contrasting, are deeply interconnected. They are two
  sides of the same coin, with each side illuminating the other. They are the
  lenses through which we perceive and interpret the world. They feed off each
  other, and together they create the spark that fuels creativity, discovery,
  and innovation.

  This spark is not the privilege of a select few; it's the common wealth of all
  mankind. It's the collective force of our curiosity, creativity, and desire
  for understanding. It connects us all, irrespective of our race, religion, or
  nationality. It's a testament to our shared humanity and our collective quest
  for knowledge and expression.

  The spark is within us all. It's in the way we perceive the world, in the way
  we question, in the way we create. Every question we ask, every discovery we
  make, every piece of art we create, contributes to this collective spark.

  In conclusion, the spark at the intersection of art and science is a testament
  to our shared human experience. It's a celebration of our collective
  curiosity, creativity, and quest for knowledge. It's a reminder that we are
  all explorers, creators, and learners. Let us cherish this spark, for it is in
  this spark that we truly recognize the common wealth of mankind.

  Thank you.

  By using spark, I mean art and science are things that inspire people to move
  forward and explore the new boundary. Could you revise?

  Ladies and Gentlemen,

  Good evening. Today, I invite you to reflect on a simple yet profound concept -
  a "spark." This spark is not merely a flicker, but a powerful force that has
  the potential to ignite curiosity, inspire innovation, and propel us into the
  realm of discovery. It is the spark that emanates from the confluence of art
  and science, two seemingly different domains, but together they form the
  common wealth of humanity.

  Art, in its essence, is a celebration of human expression. It stirs emotions,
  provokes thought, and challenges perspectives. A moving piece of music, a
  thought-provoking sculpture, or a captivating novel - they all have the
  potential to ignite a spark within us, a spark that can inspire us to see the
  world from a new perspective, to question the status quo, or to create
  something beautiful.

  Science, on the other hand, is our quest for understanding. It unravels the
  mysteries of the universe, from the tiniest subatomic particles to the vast
  expanses of the cosmos. A groundbreaking scientific theory, a revolutionary
  technological invention, or a fascinating astronomical discovery - they can
  all ignite a spark within us, a spark that can inspire us to push the
  boundaries of our knowledge, to explore uncharted territories, or to innovate
  for a better future.

  When art and science intersect, the spark they create is nothing short of
  magical. It is a spark that can inspire a scientist to approach a problem
  creatively or an artist to incorporate scientific concepts in their work. It
  is a spark that can spur an individual to step outside their comfort zone, to
  explore new boundaries, and to keep moving forward.

  This spark, ladies and gentlemen, is not just a personal experience; it is a
  collective force. It is the common wealth of mankind. It is a testament to our
  shared curiosity, creativity, and desire for progress. It is a reminder that,
  as humans, we are all explorers at heart, constantly seeking to understand,
  create, and innovate.

  In conclusion, let us cherish this spark that art and science create. Let us
  embrace it as a source of inspiration, a catalyst for innovation, and a beacon
  of progress. Let us remember that this spark, born from the confluence of art
  and science, is not just a privilege, but a responsibility. A responsibility
  to keep questioning, keep creating, and keep pushing the boundaries of what is
  possible. Because it is in this spark, in this common wealth of mankind, that
  we truly find the inspiration to move forward and explore new horizons.

  Thank you.
