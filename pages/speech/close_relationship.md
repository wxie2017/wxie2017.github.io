Two score and fifteen years ago, after ten months' close relationship, I broke
with my dear mom and came into this crazy world.

Dear contest chair, fellow toastmasters and friends.

Take a deep breath if you think that this world is crazy.

The world is so crazy that I had to go to school and do homework. I was not
afraid of the teachers. They were kind and let me go home anyway. But there
was one person that I was very afraid of. You know who she was. It was my
dear mom.

I still remeber one day I played paper cards with classmates after school
and was late at home. My mom was there waiting for me.

"Why are you so late?" I could heard the angry.

"I played." I mumbled.

"Play? Should me your homework?" Her volume became even higher.

I slowly opened my bag.

"Give it to me." She pulled the bag from me and powered out everything down
on the ground. She picked out the empty notebook and looked at me.

"Where is your homework?"

I stood there silently and you know there is going to be some close relationship.
I did not like that close relationship. That was painful.

But life was not always painful. Sometimes it was tasty.

Once mom took my younger brother and me to the town. My younger brother sat at
the front side of the bicycle, mom rode in the middle, and my father put me at
the end of the bicyle. We were all happy in the town.

When it was time to come back, there was a problem: my younger brother sat at
the front, mom rode in the middle, but I could not get on the bicycle when it
was moving. If mom stop and put me at the end, mom could not get on and rode.
There was nobody on the road.

After trying for several times, mom told me.

"I take your younger brother, and you walk back home." I could clearly see
that tears in her eyes. At that moment, I felt the close relationship between
mom and me. I nodded and mom rode away.

I walked and walked. The road seemed endless. Raise your hands if you know the
feeling of hopeless.

Suddenly, I saw a familiar figure coming towards me. It was mom riding the bicycle.
She came back from home after sending my younger brother back, and she wanted to
get me back, too. This time I liked the close relationship with my mom. It was
sweet.

You see, close relationship is an integral part of my life with my mom. Sometimes
it is painful, and sometimes it is tasty. It likes when you fly a kite in the sky,
and relationship is the string. Sometimes you release it and feel free, and
sometimes you would like to hold it tightly. The older I am, the stronger I
feel about this close relationship with my mom. The further I am away from my
home, the closer I want this relationship.

Now, I have not seen my mom for 2 years. When I pick up the phone and call back
home. She could still recognize my voice and say:

"My son, I am good, no worry. Take care of your son and your family."

Then she would just hang up the phone before I could say anything because she
could hardly hear anything.

I feel that I am gradually losing that close relationship. I feel sorry that
I am losing it.

Dear friends, when life throws challenges our way, we lean on some close
relationships for emotional support, advice, and comfort.
They help us navigate through the rough waters of life, offering solace during
the stormy times, and joy in our moments of triumph.

However, like any other aspect of life, close relationships are not always
comfortable, and are easy to lost, too.

Dear friends, when was the last time you pick up the phone and call back home?
Many of us have been working and living far away from our home. While
distance is no longer a problem for a close relationship, all you need is to
pick up your phone and make that phone call.

I wish all the close relationship shall not perish from the earth.

Thank you.
