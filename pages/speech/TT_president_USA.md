Dear Fellow members, Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

The president of the United States is the head of state of the U.S.,
the chief executive of the federal government,
and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.
The United States was the first nation to create the office of
president as the head of state in a modern republic.

An election for president of the United States happens every four
years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
The most recent presidential election was November 3, 2020.

The political landscape of the United States is dominated by
two major parties, the Democrats and Republicans.

Democrats - blue - donkey

# The Gettysburg Address - Abraham Lincoln - Republican

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long
endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have
come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting
place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate
-- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor
power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long
remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did
here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead
shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall
have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.


# Inaugural Address - Biden - Democrats

Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.

Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.

The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.

We have learned again that democracy is precious.

Democracy is fragile.

And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.

Thank you.
