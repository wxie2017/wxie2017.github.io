Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

It's the end of the year, which means I have the opportunity to raise my glass and toast something or some one.

My name is lao-xie. At this moment I would like to recall the journey as a Toastermaster. In the year of 2021,  I am proud of being the President of Yu-Life Toastmasters club.

I joined Toastmasters with the purpose of learning public speaking. Obviously you see that I could somehow speak publicly. What's more is that I have got some side effects.

One is that I have a club to run. I attend almost every club meeting and take a least a role in our club, missing one or two. Who wants to challenge this next year?

Another is that I have met so many wonderful people. We are a community, not only do we learn from each other in the club, but also we support and encourage each other as friends. Isn't this what life is all about?

In short, my reflection of 2021 is that I did it. If life is a game, I played  both for fun and to win in 2021.

Thank you.
