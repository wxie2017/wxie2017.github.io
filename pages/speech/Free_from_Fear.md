title: Free from Fear
description: This is a speech I prepare for my mentor project.
---


You and I came to Toastmasters clubs like this paper - full of schedule.
We already have much experience in our life, but we still have one thing
in common - we still fear to speak on the stage.

Dear fellow toastmasters and distinguished guests, have you ever felt
the fear when you stand on the stage facing so many eyes? I had, and I
still have.

That's normal. Many of us have the same feeling, and Toastmasters club has
already prepared a system for you. It is called mentoring. Mentors know your
fear and will help you be free from fear.

I have been mentoring a few club members. And I still remember this spring.
We had a new member. Because of the lock-down, members had never seen each
other besides on-line meetings. Because we have not had a new member for a
while, and I felt that I should call her and talk her.

Dear fellow members, when do you want me to call you?

we all fear of cold calls, but I have to take the first step.

"Hi, is this Lanlan?" My voice was a little trembling.
"Yes", a very soft female voice from the other side, making me free from fear.
"I am Laoxie. Welcome to join Yu-Life Club. How are you?" I said.
"Thanks, Laoxie. I am ok. Just stay at home." Lanlan said.
"How do you know our club?" The conversation continued.

I remember that talk lasted not 5- to 7-minute, but over 30 minutes. We talked
about Toastmasters, Pathways, English, and career. The last thing we talked
was about choosing a mentor. I told her who are qualified as mentors in our
club, I was on the list, and she said she would consider.

In a moment, I feared that she would choose me. In another moment, I feared
that she would not choose me. This was fear for unknown. Sounds familiar to
you, right?

Later, as you know, but surprised me, I became her mentor.

Mentor has one good thing. You communicate with your mentee and may know more
about her than other club members. I find that Lanlan is a natural public
speaker. I only need encourage her to follow the Pathways, and she would make
it.

I like her speeches not only because I am her mentor, but also because
she always find her own stories in the speeches. She is my mentor in this part.
This is a great talent. I fear that I could not guide her enough on this.
However, the fear is useless. Lanlan set her own goals and followed her own
pace. She finished her level 2 last month and Now she is a qualified mentor
in our club.

6 months passed. I learned many things during this mentorship. New members
do not need mentor to help them write speeches, they need mentor to help them
know the fear of public speaking, they need mentor to encourage them to speak
more. Once you let them bravely show up on the stage, they will be free from
fear, they will do great job, they will be the one they want. As a mentor, I
should like them know their wish is much bigger than their fear. Just do it.

Lanlan not only reached her own short term goal, she also sets her long term
goal. She has been taking many meeting roles in our club and other clubs, and
she has volunteered club officers for two terms already. She will go further,
and will reach higher goals.

I as her mentor, should be free from fear.

Dear fellow Toastmasters, the whole process is just like this paper, not the
paper full of schedule, but a white paper. When you have fear, you can hardly
write anything on it. When you are free from fear, you will draw your own
picture on it, you will shine your star on it, and you will be on your great
Pathways.

Raise your paper, and be free from fear.

Thank you.
