title: Free Software for you and for me

Good morning.

Some of you ask me: what do you do for a living?

Normally I answer I am doing software for vehicle systems.

Software? The reaction seems that I am talking something mysterious or far
away from our daily life.

Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

In all aspects, Software is one thing that has been changing the world
for the last few decades. Each and every one's life is connected to software
more than the Covid-19.

Do you agree?

Today I want to talk to about

1. what is software?

2. what is free software?

3. some examples of free software for our daily use

You can raise your questions at the end of my talk.

As we see, we use software every day, wechat is a software, for example.

For me, software is a program, and it is product. It has different appearances.

Sometimes it is like this (an icon) - how do you run this program?

Sometimes it is like this (binary form) - could you read it? I think this is
why people think software is mysterious.

Sometimes it is like this (source code form) - could you read it? Is it still
mysterious?

- Freedom 0: free to run the software as you wish for any purpose.
- Freedom 1: free to study how the software works and make changes as you wish.
- Freedom 2: free to distribute the original software.
- Freedom 3: free to distribute you modified version of the software.

In short, Free software means user can run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

Today, I will try to explain why we need free software. Who has a reason?

First of all, let's talk about the copyright system. It grew up with printing—a technology
for mass-production copying. Copyright fit in well with this technology because it restricted
only the mass producers of copies. It did not take freedom away from readers of books. An
ordinary reader, who did not own a printing press, could copy books only with pen and ink,
and few readers were sued for that.

Now we are in the era of digital information technology. It contributes to the world by
making copy and modification of information easier. Digital technology is more flexible than
the printing press: when information has digital form, you can easily copy and share it
with others.

Not everyone wants it to be easier. The system of copyright gives software programs “owners”,
most of whom aim to withhold software's potential benefit from the rest of the public. They
would like to be the only ones who can copy and modify the software that we use.

On the other side, what does society need? It needs information that is truly available to
its citizens—for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just
operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or
change. The users lose freedom to control part of their own lives.

Above all, sharing knowledge make human kind survive and thrive. Human society needs to
encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software owners tell us
that helping our neighbors in a natural way is “piracy”, they pollute our society's civic
spirit, and they prevent knowledge sharing. They leave human kind in danger.

This is why we say that free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

As a computer user today, you may find yourself using a proprietary program. If your friend asks
a copy, it would be wrong to refuse. But if you copy, you voliate the agreement with the
proprietary software. What should you do? Would you want to be a person living an upright life
openly with pride? This means saying no to proprietary software.

Dear friends, you deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other people who use
software. You deserve to be able to learn how the software works, and to teach your kids,
students and friends with it. You deserve to be able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it
when it breaks.

You deserve free software.

That's the very ethical reason to have free software.

Thank you.
