Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Many many years ago, when I was a little kid, my family lived in a flat
building with 6 other families. We shared a big front yard and saw each
other almost every day.

One warm spring morning, the bright sunshine streamed over the yard. A
young man came into the yard, carrying two large bamboo baskets over his
shoulder.

A street vendor, we kids, yelled and ran joyfully around him to see what
he was selling. He slowly put down the 2 baskets, and opened one of them.

Alas! In the basket, there were chickens, all those yellow, hairy, cute chickens.
We dared to touch the small things, and they even pecked our fingers.

A few families bought some chickens. My parents bought a dozen. We brothers
promised to raise them carefully.

We fed our chickens every day and they grew fast. Sadly, some died along the
way. We have 7 left: 3 roosters and 4 hens. Other neighbours had the similar.
All the roosters and hens lived in the yard.

The roosters crowed every morning and the hens laid eggs every day. The 3 roosters
sometimes fought each other, and one of them became the winner. His name is
little flower（小花）.

Little flower was a very beautiful rooster. He had bright red comb，golden yellow
neck, yellow, black body and a splendid colorful tail. His eyes are sharp bright,
and he crowed loudly and proudly.

He ruled with love. When little flower scratched up something good, he divided with
the hens. He cared the family. However, life wasn't easy in the open yard. It was a
violent time, because he had to fight to conquer more territory with other neighbour's
roosters.

He often won the fight and then stood on his toes, clapped his wings, puffed out his
golden chest and sang out. What a proud, fine looking bird he was! I was so glad.

We killed the other 2 roosters, and made delicious meals. I insisted on leaving little
flower because I liked him so much.

Next year, the street vendor came again. Now he sold bigger chickens. They grew faster
and stronger. Our neighbours bought some.

One day, I came home from school. I did not see the normal welcome from little flower
but only the hens. Where is he？ I was wondering.

I checked the hen-house. There he was! He sat deeply inside the hen-house. I called him
out. Oh ho! What happened? One of his eyes was lost with blood.

There must have been a horrifying fight between little flower and the neighbour's new
rooster. Little flower must have fought with the stronger opponent to his last feather.

But, apparently, he lost the fight and lost his eye. I was very sorrow and hold little
flower tightly, almost cried.

He still cared his hens for the days.

That weekend, my family had a chicken meal. I didn't eat. I showed my respect to
a wonderful creature who had lived his life with love and honor, glory and failure.

Farewell, little flower. Farewell, the great rooster.

Thank you.
