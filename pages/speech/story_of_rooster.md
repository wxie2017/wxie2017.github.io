Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Experiences from our childhood often remain vivid in our brain, some even
teaches us how to live our lives. Today, I tell you the story of a rooster.

Many many years ago, when I was a little kid, my family lived in a large
flat building together with 6 other families. We shared a huge front yard.

I still remember that a warm spring morning, the bright sunshine streamed
over the spacious yard. A young man came into the yard, carrying two large
bamboo baskets over his shoulder.

A street vendor, we kids yelled and ran joyfully around him to see what
he was selling. The young man slowly put down the 2 baskets, and opened
one of them.

Alas! In the basket, there were chickens, all those yellow, hairy, cute
chickens. We dared to touch the little things, and they even pecked our
fingers.

We all could not help having some.

Several families bought a few chickens. My parents bought a dozen. We brothers
promised to raise them carefully.

We fed our chickens every day and they grew fast. Sadly, some died along the
way. We have 7 left: 3 roosters and 4 hens. Other neighbours had the similar.
All the roosters and hens lived in the yard.

The roosters crowed every morning and the hens laid eggs every day. Our 3 roosters
sometimes fought each other, and one of them became the winner. His name is
little flower（小花）.

Little flower was a very beautiful rooster. He had bright red comb，golden yellow
neck, yellow and black body and a splendid colorful tail. His eyes were sharp and
bright, and he crowed loudly and proudly.

We killed the other 2 roosters, and made delicious meals. I insisted on keeping
little flower because I liked him so much.

Little flower ruled with love. When he scratched up something good in the yard, he
divided with the hens. He cared the family. However, life wasn't easy in the open
yard. It was a violent time, all the roosters had to fight to conquer more territory
for their families.

Little flower often won the fight and then he stood on his toes, clapped his wings,
puffed out his golden chest and sang out. What a proud, fine looking bird he was!
I was so glad.

Time elapsed quickly.

Next year, the street vendor came again. Now he sold better chickens. They grew faster
and stronger. Our neighbours bought some.

The yard became crowed with new roosters and hens.

One day, I came home from school. I did not see the usual welcome from little flower
but only the hens. Where was he？ I was wondering.

I checked the hen-house. There he was! Little flower sat deeply inside the hen-house.
I called him out. Oh ho! What had happened? Little flower lost one of his eyes with
blood.

It was not hard to imagine.

There must have been a horrifying fight between little flower and the neighbour's new
rooster. Little flower must have fought with the stronger opponent to his last feather.

But, apparently, he lost the fight and lost his eye. I was very sorrow and hold him
tightly, almost cried.

Little flower still cared the hens for days.

That weekend, my family had a chicken meal. I didn't eat.

I showed my respect to a wonderful creature who had lived his life with love and honor,
glory and failure, which is the very way that we all should live our lives.

Farewell, little flower. Farewell, the great rooster.

Thank you.
