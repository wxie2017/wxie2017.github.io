Fellow Toastmasters,
Dear new members,

Congratulations for taking the first step on your journey to personal and professional growth.

It is a pleasure to welcome you as the newest members of YuLife Club on behalf of all the
members. My name is Xie Wensheng. I am the SAA of our club. My job is to welcome everybody
to the meeting. Today, specially welcome you, our new members. We take pride in providing a safe,
respectful, and encouraging environment for you to develop your communication and leadership
skills. We all want you to succeed in achieving your goals.

Here are my tips for you to get started:

* Log in to www.toastmasters.org/login using your username and password.

* Enroll in Pathwaysâ€”the Toastmasters education program.

* Sample your first project, the Ice Breaker.

* Our vice president education will pair you with a mentor, to help you along the way. You can
pick someone who stands out to you in some way as your mentor. Perhaps you were really engaged
by one of their speeches. Maybe you noticed that they are highly active in supporting our club.
Or, they might already possess the kinds of skills you hope to improve upon.

Work closely with your mentor to prepare for your first speech. Your mentor
has been there before and has excellent ideas for what to speak about and
how to do it. It is important to get over any fear or nervousness regarding
your first speech. Once you complete your first speech, you will truly feel
that you are building strong relationships and becoming a valuable member of
our club.

After all, we are delighted to have you among us. Welcome to your Toastmasters
journey. There is much to learn and explore as a member of Toastmasters International
and YuLife Club. You are encouraged to ask any of our members for help. We are here
to support you.

We'd like to extend a special welcome to our president, Amanda, who will bring a
surprise to you.

Thank you.
