Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I will introduce the concept of Free Software to you. I guess all of you have used some software. right?
Here is a question. Could anyone tell me what software is?

Yes, you are right. Software is the programs that run in your computers, in your smart phones, and in many other devices.
When you double click the icon of a program, it runs. When you input the name of a program in the command line interface,
it runs. Software can do a lot things for you, like editing an article, like listening to the music, like taking a photo,
like surfing the internet, so on and so forth. In general, We call it computation: it means software does computation for
us.

Technically, software is developed by engineers in the form of source code. Source code is some kind of language for human
to read and understand just like English. Then the source code is translated to machine code using some software. Computers
understand machine code so it can execute the program. The machine code is the language designed for the machine instead of
for human beings, so it is extremely difficult for engineers to read machine code.

Now we know what software is, but what is free software? Can anyone tell me the Chinese translation of Free Software?

No, you are wrong. The Chinese translation of Free Software is 自由软件，not 免费软件。免费软件 is gratis software. The name
of Free Software in Chinese is clear, while in English the word free has 2 meanings: one for gratis, one for freedom. So we
can remember Free software as free in free speech, not free in free lunch. Free Software is about freedom, not about price.

Officially, Free Software is defined as a software that gives you 4 essential freedoms:

- Freedom 0: you are free to run the software as you wish for any purpose. No one can limit why you run the software and how
you run the software.
- Freedom 1: you are free to study how the software works and make changes as you wish. This means you must have access to
the source code to study the software. How many software do you have source code?
- Freedom 2: you are free to distribute the original software. Sharing knowledge makes human kind survive. Sharing software
is sharing knowledge. It is ethical to share software.
- Freedom 3: you are free to distribute you modified version of software as you have done with freedom 1. If you understand
Freedom 2, you would understan Freedom 3 - it makes software evolve and better.

In brief, Free software means user can run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Dear friends, next
time before you run a program, please ask yourself:
- Is the software a free software? Does it give me the 4 essential freedoms?
This is the most important thing to ask.

Thank you.
