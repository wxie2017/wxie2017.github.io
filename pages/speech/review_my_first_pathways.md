Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Today I am going to review my first completed Pathways.

My review consists of the following four parts:

1. a pleasant surprise

2. where did I start

3. the joy of passing level 1

4. I miss you

# A pleasant surprise

"Ding, Ding"
My mobile phone rang. I checked the number - an unknown number from Suzhou.

Dear audience, what would you do if you see an unknown incoming number?

Many times, I just kill it by pressing the red button because most likely
it is a spam call - trying to sale your a house, or trying to enroll your
children to a special class.

How you ever had the same experience?

But this time, thanks to god, I pressed the green button.

"Hello, are you Wensheng Xie?" said a man with southern China accent.
"Yes, I am. Who are you?" I became a little bit alert.
"I am Cui Honglun, a Toastmaster member. Congratulations, Wensheng. You
 got Quintuple Crown Award, and I invite you to attend Taicang conference
to receive the certificate."

What...???!!! I was totally relaxed.

This is a pleasant surprise! I just finished the last project of my Pathways
one week ago, and I am entitled the Quintuple Crown Award.

Dear audience, this is Toastmasters. It keeps giving you good experience
as long as you stay in the club, as long as you follow the Pathways.

I went to Taicang. It is not far from Shanghai. I took public transportation
and got off just in front of the hotel. It was already the 3rd day of the
conference.

I saw people smiling all around. I saw volunteers helping around.

I asked the reception where the venue was and told them that I did have a
ticket. The volunteer told me I could go to the second floor and check if
I was allowed to enter.

Of course, I was let in. Susan Zhou was giving her keynote speech. I could
not answer her questions:

What's the mission of a Toastmaster club?

What's the mission of a Toastmaster District?

What's the mission of the Toastmaster International?


Could you, my dear fellow members?

Soon, it's time for the Quintuple Crown Award ceremony. Looking around, I
saw familiar faces, I saw strange faces, I saw female faces, I saw male faces,
I saw people younger than me, and I saw people older than me. We have one
thing in common - we all completed a Pathways, we all finished the 5 levels.

Through conversion, I knew that some of them finished more than one Pathways,
some of them were already DTMs, and some of them were even double-DTMs. If
they can do it, I can do it, too. I told myself.

Standing on the stage, holding the certificate, something was rising from
my heart, going through my nose, and shedding out of my eyes.

I was wondering:
dear members of Yu-Life club, I miss you on the stage.
