Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Last time I introduced the concept of Free Software to you. Who can tell me what the Chinese translation of free software is?

Yes, you are right. I am glad that my last introduction worked. The Chinese translation of Free Software is 自由软件.
Free Software is about freedom, not about price.

Let us recall the essential freedoms of free software:

- Freedom 0: free to run the software as you wish for any purpose.
- Freedom 1: free to study how the software works and make changes as you wish.
- Freedom 2: free to distribute the original software.
- Freedom 3: free to distribute you modified version of software.

In short, Free software means user can run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

Today, we will try to explain why we need software software.

Thank you.
