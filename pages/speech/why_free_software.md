Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

Last time I introduced the concept of Free Software to you. Who can tell me what the Chinese
translation of free software is?

Yes, you are right. I am glad that my previous introduction worked. The Chinese translation
of Free Software is 自由软件. Free Software is about freedom, not about price.

Let us recall the essential freedoms of free software:

- Freedom 0: free to run the software as you wish for any purpose.
- Freedom 1: free to study how the software works and make changes as you wish.
- Freedom 2: free to distribute the original software.
- Freedom 3: free to distribute you modified version of software.

In short, Free software means user can run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

Today, I will try to explain why we need software software. Who has a reason?

First of all, let's talk about the copyright system. It grew up with printing—a technology
for mass-production copying. Copyright fit in well with this technology because it restricted
only the mass producers of copies. It did not take freedom away from readers of books. An
ordinary reader, who did not own a printing press, could copy books only with pen and ink,
and few readers were sued for that.

Now we are in the era of digital information technology. It contributes to the world by
making it easier to copy and modify information. Digital technology is more flexible than
the printing press: when information has digital form, you can easily copy it to share it
with others.

Not everyone wants it to be easier. The system of copyright gives software programs “owners”,
most of whom aim to withhold software's potential benefit from the rest of the public. They
would like to be the only ones who can copy and modify the software that we use.

On the other side, what does society need? It needs information that is truly available to
its citizens—for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just
operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or
change. The users lose freedom to control part of their own lives.

Above all, sharing knowledge make human kind survive and thrive. Human society needs to
encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software owners tell us
that helping our neighbors in a natural way is “piracy”, they pollute our society's civic
spirit, and they prevent knowledge sharing. They leave human kind in danger.

This is why we say that free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

As a computer user today, you may find yourself using a proprietary program. If your friend asks
a copy, it would be wrong to refuse. But if you copy, you are voliate the agreement with the
proprietary software. What should you do? Would you want to be a person live an upright life
openly with pride? This means saying no to proprietary software.

You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other people who use software. You
deserve to be able to learn how the software works, and to teach your kids, students and friends
with it. You deserve to be able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it when it breaks.

You deserve free software. That's the very ethical reason to have free software.

Thank you.
