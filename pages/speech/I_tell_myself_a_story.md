Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

(Standing here.) Now facing the screen is the same as standing on the
stage, my heartbeat is over 100 times/minute. I have fear. I feel
nervous.

Dear audience, contest chair.

Have you ever felt the same when you took part in the speech contest?
Do you have a good way to deal with this situation?

I was told to take a deep breath. That worked, just a little bit.

I was told to regard the audience as cabbages. I cannot, and you wouldn't.

My secret weapon is to tell myself a story.

In the story, I am standing on a large stage just as we have in the
Toastmasters International speech contest. The bright light sheds over
my head. I turn around (Sherrie Su 2018) and start my speech naturally like
Dananjaya Hettiarachchi (2014):
I see something in you, but I don't know what it is.

From that moment, I feel myself become Dananjaya. I am the championship
speaker. The nervousness has gone after telling myself a story. I have no
more fear to speak on the stage.

Dear Audience, telling myself a story is the magic for me to conquer my fear.
This is true for you, too. Let me ask you a question.

How many of you have kids?

We all was kids once, and some have kids now. Kids are fantastic storytellers,
and most often they tell themselves stories. We may notice that little kids
sometimes talk to themselves, talk to the toys. Sometimes they talk loudly,
sometimes they talk gentlely, and sometime they laugh out happily. They are
developing a whole story. They are telling the story to themselves. Right?

From psychological point of view, telling oneself a story is a good thing.
Private self-talk has mental benefits and practicing it positively can make
you feel confident and help you reach your goals.

I remembered that when I was in school many year ago. The home work was a lot,
not less than today's students. Sometimes we had to write the new words 10
times each. It was like a work impossible. How did I deal with this? Once I
told myself the story of magic pen of Ma Liang. In the story, I asked Ma liang
for the magic pen. He told me to write another word. I wrote, and wrote as if
I got that magic pen. Finally, I finish all the writing magically. I was happy
and the hardwork was gone.

Now I realized that in the story I was actually telling myself
Aaron Beverly (2019): This is my mission, take it very seriously.

Today, many of us are in the Toastmasters clubs. We practice public speaking
in front of people. This is not easy. Many people become nervous. It is
natural because fear of public speaking is the biggest phobia for all of us.
To conquer it, my secret is to tell myself a story of a glorious victory in
speech, and the real information is to tell myself
Mike Carr (2020): The victory is not in the result. The victory is in the try.

Dear fellow members, and distinguished guests, you can do the same.
Have you ever faced a difficlut situation? Tell yourself a story to solve the
problem.
Have you ever faced a joyful moment? Tell yourself a story to double the
happiness.
Have you ever wanted to tell your story loadly? Come to the stage.
Everything will be ok. Anyway, after 5 to 7 minutes,
Ramona J. Smith (2018): I am still standing.

Thank you.
