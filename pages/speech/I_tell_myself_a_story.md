Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

(Standing here.) Now facing the screen, my heart beat is over 100. I
feel nervous.

Dear audience, contest chair.

Have you ever felt the same when you take part in the speech contest?
Do you have a good way to deal with your nervousness?

I was told to take a deep breath. That worked, a little.

I was told to regard the audience as cabbages. I cannot, and you wouldn't.

I tell myself a story.

In the story, I am standing on a large stage just as we have in the
Toastmasters International speech contest. The bright light sheds over
my head. I start my speech natually like


I was younger. Trust me, honored judges. I was much younger.

Many many years ago, when I was a little kid, my family lived in a large
flat building together with 6 other families. We shared a huge front yard.


This is the very way that we all should live our lives.

Farewell, little flower. Farewell, the great rooster.

Thank you.
