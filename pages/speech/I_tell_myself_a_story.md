Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

(Standing here.) Now facing the screen, my heart beat is over 100. I
feel nervous.

Dear audience, contest chair.

Have you ever felt the same when you took part in the speech contest?
Do you have a good way to deal with your nervousness?

I was told to take a deep breath. That worked, just a little bit.

I was told to regard the audience as cabbages. I cannot, and you wouldn't.

I tell myself a story.

In the story, I am standing on a large stage just as we have in the
Toastmasters International speech contest. The bright light sheds over
my head. I turn around (Sherrie Su 2018) and start my speech naturally like
Dananjaya Hettiarachchi (2014):
I see something in you, but I don't know what it is.

From that moment, I feel myself become Dananjaya. I am the championship
speaker. The nervousness has gone after telling myself a story.

Dear Audience, telling myself a story is the magic for me to conquer my fear.

We all was kids once, and some have kids now. We may notice that little kids
often tell themselves a story. They talk to themselves, they talk to the toys,
they laugh loudly sometimes and they develop a whole story.Right? From
psychological point of view, telling oneself a story is a good thing. Private
self-talk has mental benefits and practicing it positively can make your goals
clear.

I remembered that when I was in school, and there were a lot of home work to
do. Sometimes we had to write the new words 10 times each. It was a hardwork.
I then told myself the story of magic pen of Ma Liang. I got that pen, and
finish all the writing magically. I was happy and the hardwork was gone. Now
I start to know that the story was tell myself
Aaron Beverly (2019): This is my mission, take it very seriously.

Today, we are all in the Toastmasters club. We practice our public speaking
in front of people. This is not easy. Public speaking is the number 1 fearness
for all of us. To conquer it, my secret is to tell myself a story of a glorious
victory, and the real information is to tell myself
Mike Carr (2020): The victory is not in the result. The victory is in the try.

Dear fellow members, and distinguished guests,
Have you ever faced a difficlut situation? Tell yourself a story to solve the
problem.
Have you ever faced a joyful moment? Tell yourself a story to share the
happiness.
Have you ever want to tell your story loadly? Come to the stage.
Everything will be ok. Anyway, after 5 to 7 minutes,
Ramona J. Smith (2018): I am still standing.

Thank you.
