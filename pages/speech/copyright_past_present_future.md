Dear Fellow members,
Distinguished guests,

Good morning.

How many of you love music？
How many of you love paintings?
How many of you love movies?
How many of you love books?

These things have one common character - they are copyrighted.

Today, I am going to talk with you about copyright, its past, its present and
its future. I will also leave a few minutes for questions and answers, so
please take note of your questions.

Long long time ago, in the ancient world, there wasn't the sharp distinction
between authorship and copying that there tends to be today. There was a
spectrum between writing an original work, and copying. Someone wrote a book,
other copied that book, and some other one might copy part of the book and
wrote her own part as well. There were many books that were partly copied,
but mixed with original writing.

I don't believe there was any idea of copyright in the ancient world and it
would have been rather difficult to enforce one, because books could be copied
by anyone who could read anywhere, anyone who could get some writing materials,
and a brush or a feather to write with. So, that was a rather clear simple
situation - copying books and writing books took similar effort. Every reader
could copy the book she read anywhere she liked. This is no concept of copyright.

Do you agree?

Later on, printing was developed and printing changed the situation greatly. It
provided a much more efficient way to make copies of books, provided that they
were all identical. And it required specialised, fairly expensive equipment that
an ordinary reader would not have. So in effect it created a situation in which
copies could only feasibly be made by specialised businesses, of which the number
was not that large. There might have been hundreds of printing presses in a
country and hundreds of thousands, or maybe even millions of actually people who
could read. So the decrease in the number of places in which copies could be made
was tremendous.

Now the idea of copyright developed along with the printing press. This would have
been in China where printing was first invented during Song dynasty, but I could
not find a reference. The system of copyright fitted in naturally with the printing
press because it became rare for ordinary readers to make copies. It still happen.
People who were very poor or very rich had handmade copies of books. The very rich
people did this to show off their wealth: they had beautiful illuminated wealth to
show that they could afford this. And poor people still sometimes copied books
by hand because they couldn't afford printed copies. As the song goes “Time ain't
money when all you got is time.” So some poor people copied books with a pen. But
for the most part the books were all made on printing presses by publishers and
copyright as a system fitted in very well with the technical system. For one thing
it was painless for readers, because the readers weren't going to make copies anyway.
And the system was fairly easy to enforce again because there were only a small number
of places where it had to be enforced: only the printing presses, and because of this
it didn't require, it didn't involve, a struggle against the public. There was very
little need trying to copy books manually, and there is no meaning to be threatened
with arrest for doing it.

And in fact, in addition to not restricting the reader's directly, it didn't cause
much of a problem for readers, because it might have added a small fraction to the
price of books but it didn't double the price, so that small extra addition to the
price was a very small burden for the readers. The actions restricted by copyright
were actions that you couldn't do, as an ordinary reader, and therefore, it didn't
cause a problem. And because of this there was no need for harsh punishments to
convince readers to tolerate it and to obey.

So copyright effectively was an industrial regulation. It restricted publishers and
writers but it didn't restrict the general public.

Do you agree?

As time went on, printing got more efficient. Eventually even poor people didn't
have to bother copying books by hand and the idea sort of got forgotten. It's about
in the 1800s that essentially printing got cheap enough so that essentially everyone
could afford printed books, so to some extent the idea of poor people copying books
by hand was lost from memory.

You didn't know of this, right?

Originally in England copyright was partly intended as a measure of censorship.
People who wanted to publish books were required to get approval from the government.
This was similar record in Song dynasty but the idea began to change and it a
different idea was expressed explicitly in the US constitution. When the US
constitution was written there was a proposal that authors should be entitled to a
monopoly on copying their books. This idea was rejected. Instead, a different idea
of the philosophy of copyright was put into the constitution. The idea is that
people have the natural right to copy things but copyright as an artificial
restriction on copying can be authorised for the sake of promoting progress.

The system of copyright would have been the same more or less either way, but
this was a statement about the purpose which is said to justify copyright. It
is explicitly justified as a means to promote progress, not as an entitlement
for copyright owners. So the system is meant to modify the behaviour of copyright
owners so as to benefit the public. The benefit consists of more books being
written and published and this is intended to contribute to the progress of
civilisation, to spreading ideas, and as a means to this end. In other words as
a means to this end copyright exists. So this also thought of as a bargain
between the public and authors; that the public gives up its natural right to
make copies of anything in exchange for the progress that is brought about
indirectly, by encouraging more people to write.

Dear audience, when you hear the word "pirate" what do you feel? Pirates
attach boats with weapons, but sharing copied books is spreading ideas, is
contributing to the progress of civilization.

Anyway, as long as the age of the printing press continued, copyright was
painless, easy to enforce, and probably a good idea. But the age of the
printing press began changing a few decades ago when things like Xerox
machines and tape recorders started to be available, and more recently as
computer networks have come into use the situation has changed drastically.
We are now in a situation technologically more like the ancient world,
where anybody who could read something could also make a copy of it that
was essentially as good as the best copies anyone could make.

A situation now where once again, ordinary readers can make copies themselves.
It doesn't have to be done through centralised mass production, as in the
printing press. Now this change in technology changes the situation in which
copyright law operates. The idea of the bargain was that the public trades
away its natural right to make copies, and in exchange gets a benefit. Well,
a bargain could be a good one or a bad one. It depends on the worth of what
you are giving up. And the worth of what you are getting. In the age of the
printing press the public traded away a freedom that it was unable to use.

What are the consequences when copyright starts restricting activities that
ordinary readers can do. Well, for one thing it's no longer an industrial
regulation. It becomes an imposition on the public. For another, because of
this, you find the public's starting to object to it You know, when it is
stopping ordinary people from doing things that are natural in their lives
you find ordinary people refusing to obey. Which means that copyright is no
longer easy to enforce and that's why you see harsher and harsher punishments
being adopted by governments that are basically serving the publishers rather
than the public.

Also, you have to question whether a copyright system is still beneficial.
Basically, the thing that we have been paying is now valuable for us. Maybe
the deal is a bad deal now. So all the things that made technology fit in
well with the technology of the printing press make it fit badly with
digital information technology.

Now what are some of the changes we might want to make in copyright law in
order to adapt it to the situation that the public finds itself in?

Well the extreme change might be to abolish copyright law but that isn't
the only possible choice. There are various situations in which we could
reduce the power of copyright without abolishing it entirely because there
are various different actions that can be done with a copyright and there
are various situations in which you might do them, and each of those is an
independent question.

Should copyright cover this or not? In addition, there is a question of
“How long?”. Copyright used to be much shorter in its period or duration,
and it's been extended over and over again in the past fifty years or so
and in fact in now appears that the owners of copyrights are planning to
keep on extending copyrights so that they will never expire again.


In the future, we should draw lines between different kinds of work.
Different works serve different purposes for their users. Until today
we've had a copyright system that treats almost everything exactly
alike except for music. There are broadly three kinds of works:

functional works,
works that express personal position,
and works that are fundamentally aesthetic.

Functional works include: computer software; recipes; textbooks;
dictionaries and other reference works; anything that you use to get
jobs done. For functional works people need very broad freedom,
including the freedom to publish modified versions, because it
necessary to have the freedom to publish a modified version to get
job done.

The second category of works is works that express someone's positions
or views or experiences. For example, essays, offers to do business
with people, statements of one's legal position, memoirs, anything
that says, whose point is to say what you think or you want or what
you like. Book reviews and restaurant reviews are also in this category:
it's expressing a personal opinion or position. For these kinds of works,
making a modified version is not a useful thing to do. Verbatim copying
is the only thing that people need to have the freedom to do and because
of this we can consider the idea that the freedom to distribute copies
should only apply in some situations.

The third category of works is aesthetic works, whose main use is to
be appreciated; novels, plays, poems, drawings in many cases, typically
and most music. Typically it's made to be appreciated. Now, they're not
functional people don't have the need to modify and improve them, the
way people have the need to do that with functional works. So it's a
difficult question: is it vital for people to have the freedom to publish
modified versions of an aesthetic work.

If there is a system where those who commercially redistribute or maybe
even those who are publishing a modified version might have to negotiate
the sharing of the payments with the original developers and then this
kind of scheme could be extended to those works too even if modified
versions are permitted there could be some standard formula which could
be in some cases renegotiated, so I think in some cases probably possible
even with a system of permitting in some way publishing modified
versions of the aesthetic works it may be possible still to have a kind
of voluntary payment system.

There is evidence ideas like this are not unreasonable. As you know, there
are already many personal-made-media for profit, which are very successful.

All in all, fundamentally, the stated purpose of copyright: to encourage
righting is a worthwhile purpose, but we have to look at ways of ways to
achieve it that are not so harsh, and not so constricting of the use of
the works whose developments we have encouraged and I believe that digital
technology is providing us with solutions to the problem as well as creating
a context where we need to solve the problem.

This is the end of the talk, now are there questions?

Question 1: When is China began to have copyright?

As you know, printing was invented by ancient China people. If copyright
was related to printing, China should have it. There are historical record
in China similar to copyright, such as in Song Dynasty （1100）, the
government prevented copying of published books as commercial goods.

In 1901, Qing dynasty published an official copyright law of China.

In the world, Western scholars believe copyright began in England in 1500s.

Question 2: How long is China's copyright protection?

As a citizen in China, copyright last till 50 years after the author's death.
As an organization in China, copyright last till 50 years as the work published.

Thank you.
