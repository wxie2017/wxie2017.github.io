  01 - self introduction
  Hi, Grace:

  This is a very interesting self introduction. It is full of shining points.
  From the text, I see a clear profile of a warm-hearted young person in
  Shanghai, who has a great goal in finding and spreading special things. I like
  the English part personally because you connect Toastmasters with me. This
  makes your introduction more engaging.

  I also find the humor between your name and 挖掘机。It can make me a good
  fortune.

  When I Iisten to your speech version, what a nice voice of young girl. It's
  confident, it's stable, and it's sweet. This could be the voice of a great
  public speaker.
  The ending calls for action, while I hope you can add your name to let people
  remember it.

  In summary, this introduction draws a vivid picture of you with your specific
  interests. Please keep on telling more stories.

  Hi, Maggie:

  How fluent and natural this self introduction is!
  I like your opening very mich. It connects with friends,
  it illustrates the sense of humor, and it lets people
  remeber you are Maggie.

  You voice is very warm, just like you set your
  life goal to be good. Many people will remeber
  you Form this beatiful voice. I hear the real
  passion you habe for your goal.

  The ending is short. I was expecting a recall of
  your Name, and maybe additional Humor.

  All in all, this is a wonderful work. I am looking
  forward to your next speech.

  02 - Accepting awards
  Hi,Maggie:
  Thank you for ringing the Bell another time.
  I know you will do it.

  Your words for a speech champion are well
  written. You expose the secrets of your success -
  practice and keep calm. You also express your
  apprieciation to the Mentor, who guides you
  the journey. These are fantastic elements in
  a speech of accepting an award.

  In the voice Version, you clearly deliver the
  content, using pauses and vocal variety to
  make the speech vivid. I like the fluency in
  the whole speech time.

  When you finish the recording, I think you
  notice the time is over 2 Minuten 30 seconds.
  This can make your gold speech unqualified
  in a real contest. Plesse note.

  Another thing I see is that you are too calm
  in a champion award speech. The excitement should
  be more outgoing, the voice should be trembling,
  the speed should be faster.

  Maggie, you surely make progress in this speech.
  All you need is like you said, pratice and
  feel the passion yourself.

  Looking forward to your speech tomorrow.

  03 - PREP
  Hi, Maggie:

  Thanks for coming again with such a touching
  story about your grandma.

  Your speech follows the PREP structure. I hear
  the point clearly Form the first sentence which
  naturally gets my interest to follow your speech.

  After making your point clearly, you Start to
  illustrate how your grandma loves you, encourages
  you, and inspires you. I am moved by these
  examples.

  Finally, the point is rephrased, and becomes
  your true emotion through your voice. Super
  good Endung.

  This time you habe an exact time control. You
  See, using the PREP frame, you can do a perfect
  impromptu speech.

  Really expecting your next speech. Maybe I hope
  it is in English.

  Hi, Grace:
  I am glad that you have finally made your check-in.
  It must be the power of your dream.

  I See clearly the PREP structure in your speech.
  You answer the question with short and powerful
  words - belief and love. I can feel your emotion
  in the Video. Your volume goes higher, and your
  eyes are shining. Good information.

  Your R part is particularly important. Many
  people will go to E without mich R. Your R
  connects the later E to the point. This helps
  the audience digest your point. Gold Engagement.

  Your final question is another shining point.
  It makes your point Mord valuable. Who would
  refuse a calm for dream?

  I know you usw your dear friend AS an example.
  I want to hear how she inspires you. If you
  habe this, your example would be Mord relevant.

  In short, this is an excellent impromptu
  speech both in content and in delivery.

  Plesse keep the Momentum.

  04 - vocal variety
  Hi, Maggie:

  Congratulations! Four days already. You habe
  done the homework 4 days in a roll. Great
  perseverance.

  You choose to do the longer story. I feel
  your voice fits this story well. The opening
  likes a radio program for kids - soft and deep.

  Your rythm keeps steady, and suddenly changes
  to high volume when the old bird flies down.
  This is exactly the point of interest. You geht
  it. I feel your emotion to the old bird.

  At the End, you voice becomes calm again. It
  leaves space for listeners to ponder.

  The whole process is very natural. Good control.
  I find that the overall volume is low, and I
  have to hold the phone near my ear. It would
  good if I can use my ears.

  All in all, I See that you can match your voice
  to the story in your way, and make the story
  vivid.

  Hope you will integrate this skill in the next
  speech.

  Hi, Grace:

  I am Glad that you keep your promise and make
  your homework. It isn't easy. Give yourself
  a big applause.

  In this speech, I really notice that you try
  to control your vocal variety.

  You start with slow speed which I feel the
  growing passion and power in the voice. As
  you gradually draw the snow image using your
  slow pace, I can follow the scenery and image
  the beatiful landscape.

  When you move to the people part, you raise the
  volume. This is good. It matches the rythm of
  the poem.

  Your ending is even slower which is full of
  expectation. The whole work is harmonious.
  Good job.

  There are a few places that you speak two
  words together, such AS "yuyu". I hope you
  can improve this, like " yu - yu".

  This is one of the good works for today. It
  is full of emotion and power. Thank you, Grace.
  Keep ging.

  05 - gestures
  Hi, Maggie:

  It's nice to See you again. This time through
  the Video of your watermellon distribution.

  First I watch the Video without audio. I understand
  that you are explaining some funny thing. I
  See that it moves Form right to left, and grows
  From one to three.At last, it becomes bigger.
  Your gestures make the thing for me.

  Then, I watch your Video with sound. Ohho, you
  are cutting a watermellon. Your voice matches
  the gestures.There are paces Form 1 to 3.

  I believe you learn how to usw these gestures
  in your future speeches.

  You usw portrait screen to shot the Video, which
  cannot hold the whole gestures. You can try
  Landscape next time.

  You See, gestures are so easy. Keep cutting
  the watermellon, bigger and bigger.

  Hi, Grace:

  Thank you for Sending me a big watermellon.
  You delivery it At night. I receive it in the
  morning. I like it.

  Your watermellon is big. You open both of
  your arms to show me that. This gets my attention.

  Your watermellon is hard. I See your cut is
  very powerful - left, middle, right, up and down.
  I cannot hold expecting the next.

  When you distribute the watermellon, I like
  your opening hand towards me. I feel the sweet
  watermellon is for me, no matter one, two, or
  three. Great gestures.

  I notice you face down to the camera so your
  eyes are not straight ahead. This is a little
  strange for me. I would like to See you standing
  naturally facing me next time.

  In general, the whole Video is fluent and clear under the
  quiet, dark sky. A sense of commitment. Good
  job. You get the idea of using structured
  gestures on the stage.

  06 - a purpose
  Hi, Maggie:

  Thank for coming and bringing a hard topic -
  stereotypes.

  It is a hard topic for me because stereotypes
  are so common in my life that I cannot talk
  against Thema confidently. I myself often
  Fall in certain stereotypes and still feel
  good. For example, I strongly believe doing
  well in school leads to doing a good job in
  works. This has been proven wrong Many times.
  Therefore, I would like to know how to change
  the stereotype mindset and embraces more
  chances and challenges in future life.

  I know you have much experience in dealing with
  different kinds of people. In the process, you
  must learn some useful skills to Cole with
  stereotypes. Hope you also talk about Them.

  Really expecting a long speech about this defying
  topic. You can do it. Just do it, Maggie.

  Hi, Grace:

  Dream! What a topic! Who doesn't have a dream?
  Or had a dream? Just speaking out your dream is
  bold and brave. Thank you for doing this.

  There must be some special triggers that makes
  your be aware of your dream. I really want to
  hear these moments. They will certainly touch
  something in my heart - that's resonance,
  that's inspiring, and that's the purpose of
  a public speech.

  Form your words of explanation, I already
  feel your fired passion of your own dream,
  and your Burning desire to talk about it.
  Just go and do it.

  I will be there listening and applauding.

  07 - write the opening

  Hi, Maggie:

  Thank you for making the great opening of your
  speech. It's in English. I like it. I learn
  both public speaking and English.

  I See you use questions in your opening. This
  is a very good technique to engage your audience.
  Your speech succeeds Mord Thank half if you
  attract the audience in the beginning.

  Your eyecontacts are super good in the Video.
  You keep your eyes facing the camera. I feel
  you are talking to me. I must listen. Very
  good eyecontacts and show your confidence.

  The time is properly control in about 1 minute.
  This is important AS well.

  I notice that you smile During the speech, which
  is great. While, When you are talking about
  troubles you can use other facial expression,
  like worried look. Your volume is low for me,
  so I cannot tell you vocal variety. Maybe you
  can adjust it in your story part.

  Overall, this is a good opening in that it
  engages the audience using questions and
  eyecontacts. It would be good you can apply
  more on facial expression and raise the
  volume.

  Looking forward to the story part.

  Hi, Grace:

  Congratulations to you for starting telling
  your dream.

  You use questions in your opening. Furthur,
  you also give some answers. These questions
  and answers connects you with the audience.
  This a very good opening.

  When you ASK, your voice is clear and loud,
  I feel I am asked, I need find the answers.
  Your eyes are straight, I feel I am cared.
  This makes you a sincere speaker. You are
  talking to me, not talking At me. You have
  done an exellent job in vocal variety and
  eyecontact. Keep this.

  Your gestures is not as open as you learn
  the watermellon. Your hands are keep near
  your body, which shows your are worried.
  You can try to open your Bands When asking
  a question, and close When giving an answer.
  Make your style of gestures.

  The last sentence is a statement. Would you
  like to try it with a question. Then your
  answer will come next.

  Above all, I like your opening. It attracts
  me using questions and answers along with
  your beatiful voice. If you can put bigger
  gestures, it would be more powerful. You are
  talking about dreams. Dream big.

  Looking forward to your dream.

  08 - the story

  Hi, Maggie:

  Thank you for telling such a touching story.
  Your story is about your daughter and a nanny.
  This is a common Situation, so it is easily
  connected with the audience.

  In the story, you wanted to find a nanny for
  your New born baby. However, you set a limitation
  baesd on a stereotype. Of course, you failed
  to get a good nanny.

  Things changes. You has to choose a nanny without
  that limitation. Well, you are satisfied.

  You learned that your stereotype is wrong.

  This structure fits the taught scenario. You
  have got the essence.

  In the Video, your voice are louder than the
  previous ones. Your gestures are meaningful.
  I See that you are emotional When you are telling
  the specific night because your voice are full
  of real thanks.

  I find that there are 2 places you could have
  Tried some Details. 1. You can use Dialog to
  describe the conflicts between the agency's
  final recommendation and your stereotype. 2.
  You can use real gestures to show how Xiao Qian
  took care of the baby.

  All in all, congratulations for telling a
  good story and Teach US a good lesson. You have
  done well in structuring a story. If you can
  add a little more details, the story would be
  more vivid.

  Looking forward to your next story.

  Hi, Grace:

  Thank you for making up your story even after
  the course. I See it is already very late when
  you submit this. This shows your commitment in
  improving yourself.

  Your story has all the elements of an attractive
  story: dream, work, joy, change, sadness, change,
  joy again, and a message to the audience. These
  are very well connected in your logic. When I
  listen, I get your Main point - find your
  dream and work towards your dream. You inspires
  me.

  You are very fluent in delivery. You seldom
  use Fuller words, like EM, ah. You must have
  practiced a lot. That's great.

  What I See is that there are still rooms in
  your story to add more details. Maybe an
  event happened about Mr. Zhang, maybe a small
  talk with your colleague, maybe your own joy
  with Findung your dream, people can remember
  Details, this your speech. Well can discuss
  this later.

  All in all, I like your story. It is very
  inspiring with your excellent show.

  Looking forward to your full demo.

  09 - more about story

  Hi, Grace:

  I am glad you come back with an excellent
  story. Congratulations to your 9th day.

  I find your speech structure is a perfect one
  fitting the Ostern - idea - work - Frustration
  - change - idea. You really have a good
  command of such a structure. It is very
  effektive.

  During your speech, You eyes are steady facing
  the camera. Your voice are clear and loud. These
  shows that you are confident about your story,
  about your dream.

  You deliver the speech fluently. I think you
  must have made great effort of practice. This
  is very good.

  I would like to suggest adding more Details
  in Your story. For example, your teacher is
  crazy so you may create one of his/her crazy
  Moment as your beginning. This may enhance
  the stories, thus the importance of a dream.
  Further, in the end you can picturize another
  crazy Moment of the teacher to recall the
  beginning. How do you like it?

  In a nutshell, this is a well-structured speech.
  Your delivery is confident and fluent. If you
  add more Details in Your story, it would be
  a master piece.

  Looking forward to your next speech.

  Hi, Maggie:

  Thank you for this improved Version of your
  nanny story. Remarkable job.

  I See that you add the dialogue Düring the
  nanny searching part. The way you add it is
  very natural. Your vocal variety in the call
  is terrific. Your steadiness of the stereotypes
  is illustrated in your tone. Well done.

  You also add Many Details for showing the
  excellent job of Xiao Qian. The gestures are
  with emotional. The voice is full of apprieciation.
  This makes your following change and narration
  more meaningful. This is a shining point.

  If I may tell you to go a little Further, it
  would be the dialogue Role play. When I switch
  off the audio, I can hardly tell that your
  dialogue in the Video because your gestures
  are very similar for You and the agent. If
  you can try to use different gestures or
  positions for different roles, for example,
  When you are calling, Maybe one of your arms
  can hold your daughter. I think this is truer.

  All I can day is that this is a mich better
  Version. You use dialogue and gestures to
  descibe Details, make the story with blood and
  meat. If you act a bit Rolle play, it would
  be even attractive.

  Good job, Maggie. Keep the momentum. You will
  win the trophy.

  10 - ending

  Hi, Grace:

  It's nice to hear your voice again. Thank
  you for the hard work - I See you submit the
  homework in the later night.

  Your ending gives a good summary of your idea
  in the speech. Well done. I find the question
  you ask is particular important. It helps the
  audience to resonate the whole speech: pursue
  your dream, follow your heart.

  Your voice is excellent Düring the ending,
  clear and calm. This makes your summary very
  convincing. Because you believe it, the audience
  will follow you.

  I find some of your gestures not really marching
  your words or your voice. I would suggest the
  following. When you ask the question, you can
  open your Hand to the audience. Let Them think.
  When you say listen to your inner voice, you
  can put your hand At your heart to show wäre
  the voice is from. What do you think?

  All in all, your ending serves as a good summary
  of your speech. You deliver it with good
  confident voice. All you can try is to make
  more meaningful gestures.

  Pratice it. Looking forward to your dream to
  come true.

  Hi, Maggie:

  Glad to hear the ending of your speech.

  It is very well done. Finally wie have bot
  your great advice on how to deal with
  stereotypes and futher have a better world.
  This is a powerful message. Good ending.

  Your transfer from the story to ending is also
  very smooth. From personal experience to
  general conclusion for specific situstion is
  your key to change the position to the audience.
  You handle it excellently.

  Your vocal variety in this piece improved.
  You raise the volume When asking the question.
  This is important. If you can make more
  occurance of the word - stereotype - in the
  whole speech, your key message will be much
  more stronger.

  Thank you for doing such a good speech and
  a powerful ending. Looking forward to your
  further performance.

  11 - full Text

  Hi, Maggie:

  Thank you for finishing today's assignment
  early.

  It is exciting to See that you are brave
  enough to be the second English speech in
  the group. If you can do it in a foreign
  language, it should be easier in Chinese.

  The word stereotype walks through your text
  from the beginning to the end. This is a very
  clear keynote. Good strategy.

  I don't See the dialogue part. Maybe you are
  going to do it live.

  I give a tip to help you memorize the long
  text. You can draw a picture of your story.
  Keep the picture in your mind. When you
  deliver, just image you are drawing. Very
  easy.

  Keep practicing. You will find your own way
  on the stage. Good luck, Maggie.
